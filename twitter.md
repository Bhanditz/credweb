# Credibility assessment exercises on Twitter

* Decide which item you want to assess (usually some news article or news source), then start a thread with a tweet which includes the URL of that item.  Make your following tweets in the same assessment be replies in a chain.
* Optionally, start the first tweet with @cred_web so that your followers wont see it unless they also follow @cred_web.  This is probably good for now.
* Optionally, look in [Credibility Signals](/Signals) for suggested template statements, and use them (filled in) when you agree.  If nothing seems right, tweet whatever does seem right.
* Try to make simple, factual statements, recording your observations. This can include your judgements, as observations of your mental state and mental process.
* Don't say anything sarcastic.  Yes, this is Twitter, but that's probably not helpful in this context.
* Don't @ people for now, unless you're sure you want to draw them into this.  You can refer to twitter users (and users of other social media) using the URL of their main/profile page.  For example, use https://twitter.com/sandhawke not @sandhawke.
