# Credibility assessment exercises on Twitter

Here's a way we can explore credibility assessment, together.  Basically, post your signal data as tweets, in natural language.  Make it up as you go, and lets see what we end up with.

You can make an anonymous (throw-away) twitter account for this, if you like.

Step by step:

1. Decide which item you want to assess.  Pick some news article, news organization, person, or anything visible on the web where it matter if people believe it. Or you can assess a bit of text, such as a claim people are repeating. This excercise will probably be much more interesting if you have strong feelings about the thing you pick.  It may also help to think about (and maybe tag) someone else who has strong feelings about it.
1. Start a thread with a tweet which includes the URL of that item, and explain what you're doing.  Link here if you want.  Make your following tweets in the same assessment be replies in a chain.
1. Optionally, start the first tweet with @cred_web so that your followers wont see it unless they also follow @cred_web.  This is probably good for now.
1. Try to make simple, factual statements, recording your observations. This can include your judgements, as observations of your mental state and mental process.
1. Don't say anything sarcastic.  Yes, this is Twitter, but that's probably not helpful in this context.
1. Don't @ people for now, unless you're sure you want to draw them into this.  You can refer to twitter users (and users of other social media) using the URL of their main/profile page.  For example, use https://twitter.com/sandhawke not @sandhawke.
1. If you run out of ideas for things to say about your subject, look in [Credibility Signals](/signals) for more ideas.  You could even try some of the template statements (filled in), if they seem right.
