## Agenda: Credible Web CG Face-to-Face Meeting (26-27 July 2018)

### Goals

For each project area (1-inspection, 2-corroboration, 3-reputation, 4-transparency), produce:
* document: an improvement in current report or specification (eg from blank page to outline, from draft to improved draft, etc)
* issues: a list of open issues / tasks for moving forward
* outside: a list of relevant stakeholders and/or related projects
* inside: a list of group members interested in working on it in coming months
* implementations: a list of potential software products/features that would interoperate using this kind of data (and real ones that already do, if any)

### Registration

Members of the group who plan to attend in person **or remotely** should use the [Register/Regrets form](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/103073/credweb-f2f2/).  They can also use the "results" link on that form to see other responses.

Non-members are strongly encouraged to [join the group](https://www.w3.org/community/wp-login.php?redirect_to=%2Fcommunity%2Fcredibility%2Fjoin) and use the above form.  If there is an obstacle to joining, please contact team-credweb-chairs@w3.org about attending as a guest.

In-person registration is expected to be capped at 25.

### Location

The meeting will be held in Meedan's co-working space ([runway](http://www.runway.is/)), in Suite 488 at [1355 Market, San Francisco](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Market+Square,+1355+Market+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94103/@37.7768337,-122.4185642,17z/).

The site is a short walk from the [BART](https://www.bart.gov/) Civic Center station, making it easily accessible from anywhere on the system.  Driving is a challenge, especially from the East Bay.

### Topics

For a general summary of the scope of the group, see [slides for the W3C Advisory Committee](http://hawke.org/talk-ac-2018/).

Major topic areas expected for this meeting:

* Areas for Machine Interop
    * Area 1 / Inspection : What features of Web Content might be helpful in evaluating its credibility, especially at scale
    * Area 2 / Corroboration : Possibilities for improving ClaimReview deployment and features, and other claim-centric mechanisms for establishing trust
    * Area 3 / Reputation : How can one determine how much to trust a particular source?  What might software and social information sharing do to help?
    * Area 4 / Transparency : Can standards for disclosure and self-description be useful?

Areas 1 and 2 are likely to receive the most time at the meeting, and may run in parallel tracks for part of the time.

* Related Areas for Discussion and Study
    * Connections to related efforts: mapping the territory and dividing the work.
    * Trust in Science: the public is often surprisingly misinformed and mistrustful of science.  What can or should be done?  This application area is particularly useful as often having a consensus truth, unlike in politics
    * Conspiracy Theories: another application area where the truth seems fairly clear, and the psychological mechanisms of trust may be more visible   
    * Review Board: can we establish a "horizontal" review process to help make sure any outputs of the group (and perhaps related groups) are relatively safe and effective 
    * Vocabulary lifecycle: development, documentation, migration

### Schedule

The meeting will run approximately 9am-6pm Pacific Time on both days.
Exact **timing may change** in the days leading up to the meeting, as
we learn more timing constraints from participants. If you a strongly
attached to a topic and can only attend part of the time, be sure to
let the chairs know asap.
