### Location

The meeting will be held in Meedan's co-working space ([runway](http://www.runway.is/)), in Suite 488 at [1355 Market, San Francisco](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Market+Square,+1355+Market+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94103/@37.7768337,-122.4185642,17z/).

The site is a short walk from the Civic Center station of the BART public transit system, making it easily accessible from anywhere on the system.  Driving is not generally recommended, especially from the East Bay.

### Topics

For a general summary of the scope of the group, see [slides for the W3C Advisory Committee](http://hawke.org/talk-ac-2018/).

Major topic areas expected for this meeting:

* Areas for Machine Interop
    * Area 1 / Inspection : What features of Web Content might be helpful in evaluating its credibility, especially at scale
    * Area 2 / Corroboration : Possibilities for improving ClaimReview deployment and features, and other claim-centric mechanisms for establishing trust
    * Area 3 / Reputation : How can one determine how much to trust a particular source?  What might software and social information sharing do to help?
    * Area 4 / Transparency : Can standards for disclosure and self-description be useful?

Areas 1 and 2 are likely to receive the most time at the meeting, and may run in parallel tracks for part of the time.

* Related Areas for Discussion and Study
    * Connections to related efforts.  Mapping the territory and dividing the work.
    * Trust in Science.  The public is often surprisingly misinformed and mistrustful of science.  What can or should be done?  This application area is particularly useful as often having a consensus truth, unlike in politics
    * Conspiracy Theories.  Another application area where the truth seems fairly clear, and the psychological mechanisms of trust may be more visible   
    * Vocabulary lifecycle: development, documentation, migration

### Schedule

The meeting will run approximately 9am-6pm on both days.  Exact timing
of sessions to be determined when we have more complete attendence
information.
