## Agenda: Credible Web CG (11 April 2018)

*This will be an informal discussion meeting, with no group decisions
 made, as people are still in the process of joining the group.*

1. Connect

    Video is great if you can, otherwise just use a phone to dial in.
    If you're not confident in your setup -- including how to mute
    yourself -- please try connecting 5-10 minutes early to make sure
    your camera, microphone, headset, etc is working. Someone will
    usually be available to help you test.  If you're unable to
    connect, try asking for help on zulip.  If you can't get to zulip,
    email team-credweb-chairs@w3.org

    Starts 10:05am SFO, 1:05pm New York, 5:05pm London, 6:05pm Paris;
    and runs for up to 85 minutes, depending on business.
