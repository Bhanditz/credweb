        This document aims to increase interoperability among systems
        cooperating to make the web more trustworthy.  The approach
        taken here is to exchange "indicators" which potentially show
        which items of web content (initially news articles) are
        worthy of greater trust.

This can be due to licensing agreements from a wire service or the article can simply be stolen without crediting the original article. Sometimes the article is copied wholesale while other times some words are changed or a new article is created that copies from multiple articles. Finally, some articles will quote extensively from one or more other articles with only a small amount of original reporting or writing.</dd><dt>Release Target</dt><dd>1</dd><dt>Source Team</dt><dd>Credibility Coalition Study: Web Conference 2018</dd></dl>
