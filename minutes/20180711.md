<a id="1531329382" href="#1531329382">#</a> [Cheryl Langdon-Orr] *and yes the background noise in my audio track is snoring (not mine) these meetings are at 0300 for me. I am UTC +10 time zone wise.*

<a id="1531329854" href="#1531329854">#</a> [An Xiao Mina] *Here's the report I mentioned: Information Disorder: The Definitional Toolbox: https://firstdraftnews.org/infodisorder-definitional-toolbox. Has useful frameworks for us.*

<a id="1531330589" href="#1531330589">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: not sure "info disorder" is an apt term for the problem, @**An Xiao Mina** agrees

<a id="1531330621" href="#1531330621">#</a> [Jon Udell] *Poverty is mentioned as a wicked problem, but as @**Owen Ambur** notes, we've actually made a ton of progress on that front.*

<a id="1531330791" href="#1531330791">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: (shared screen of above link): The idea is that there are 2 dimensions useful for clustering. Between theory/practice (knowing/doing), and between medium/message (infrastructure/content)

<a id="1531330881" href="#1531330881">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: Media Cloud (for example) fits into upper-left (theory/content).

<a id="1531330932" href="#1531330932">#</a> **David Karger** says: : On the theory/practice axis, where do you put an experimental intervention?

<a id="1531330976" href="#1531330976">#</a> [Reto Gmür] *there's such a lot of noise*

<a id="1531331116" href="#1531331116">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *Research - Practice , or Theory - Application*

<a id="1531331235" href="#1531331235">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *(from @**David Karger***

<a id="1531331398" href="#1531331398">#</a> **Ed Bice** says: the Mexican election monitoring is upper right: practical, content-oriented.

<a id="1531331783" href="#1531331783">#</a> [Jon Udell] *Chris Guess says: Duke Reporter's lab, Share the Facts is mostly infrastructure, towards theory,  Scraping for Fact Checking more content-oriented.*

<a id="1531331809" href="#1531331809">#</a> [An Xiao Mina] *the content <> infrastructure spectrum is a rough way we were trying to reference "the stack"*

<a id="1531331955" href="#1531331955">#</a> [Jon Udell] *Chris Guess says: NLP, claim matching are more on the theoretical side.*

<a id="1531332033" href="#1531332033">#</a> **Reto Gmür** says: SWAN (above) skews toward theory/infrastructure

<a id="1531332048" href="#1531332048">#</a> [Annette Greiner] *maybe the medium is the message?*

<a id="1531332144" href="#1531332144">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: Facebook's feed algorithm would be at the bottom of the vertical (content/infrastructure) axis

<a id="1531332209" href="#1531332209">#</a> [An Xiao Mina] *some comments from cheryl in the zoom chat: Axm that scatter graph makes better sense to me (strung together)
you can always overlay other quadrant scatter graphs  for different sectors/Actors*

<a id="1531332265" href="#1531332265">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: social science top left,  computer science bottom left

<a id="1531332548" href="#1531332548">#</a> [Owen Ambur] *5*

<a id="1531332562" href="#1531332562">#</a> [Cheryl Langdon-Orr] *Active and Passive Opportunities  useful but different purpose*

### Brainstorming for F2F meeting

<a id="1531332778" href="#1531332778">#</a> **Annette Greiner** says: the motivating problem for me, working in science, there's a ton of scientific misinfo, are there things we can do to help people recognize when they're being fed false science and dichotomies?

<a id="1531333064" href="#1531333064">#</a> **Annette Greiner** says: : Scientists tend to use weasel words to avoid overstating a case, which muddies the waters.

<a id="1531333166" href="#1531333166">#</a> [Cheryl Langdon-Orr] *Can we make sure that the Agenda for the F2F is tight on the times for topics to start so that ay of us only remote participating can make sure we get into the right bits at the right times...  e.g. as a (by Degree last Century)  Scientist this topic peaks my specific interest :-)*

<a id="1531333224" href="#1531333224">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: we might want to plan a session on science and science reporting
