<a id="1528909689" href="#1528909689">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *+1*

<a id="1528909709" href="#1528909709">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *RESOLVED: approve minutes of 30 may*

### Events, I Annotate

<a id="1528910054" href="#1528910054">#</a> **Ed Bice** says: that Jonathan Stray, who was on the journo panel, is a strong ally.

<a id="1528910099" href="#1528910099">#</a> **Ed Bice** says: slides from his flash talk (on our work, and CredCo's) will be available.

### Events, Info Disorder conf

<a id="1528910242" href="#1528910242">#</a> [An Xiao Mina] *This was a nice summary posted publicly by an attendee: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GcKAzgcF7ESYaeoFGZhBnK7Nbj0jvDoKcs22zUieq1k/edit*

<a id="1528910248" href="#1528910248">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: a rapid response mechanism was discussed

<a id="1528910329" href="#1528910329">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: he went to a workshop on deep fakes (e.g. video), we fall back to provenance as only solution, but losing anonymity is a tradeoff

### Events, Story Science, Univ of Florida

<a id="1528910473" href="#1528910473">#</a> [An Xiao Mina] *And here's info about MisinfoCon DC, which I mentioned as potentially of interest to this community: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/misinfocon-dc-a-policy-summit-on-misinformation-registration-46774656256*

<a id="1528910478" href="#1528910478">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: there were also psychologists weighing in on how to rebuild trust

<a id="1528910542" href="#1528910542">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: when there's a really big brand, CNN or NYT, it's gonna break your trust from time to time, smaller brands probably can be more trustworthy over time, just a hunch, maybe some way to test that

### Events, Misinfocon in Kiev

<a id="1528910629" href="#1528910629">#</a> **Scott Yates** says: while there, the Arkady [surname?] kerfuffle happened

<a id="1528910803" href="#1528910803">#</a> **Scott Yates** says: https://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/rsf-trust-initiative will take a while, but will provide a strong trust signal

<a id="1528910849" href="#1528910849">#</a> **Scott Yates** says: that will not be a certifying body, only a standards body, certification will have to happen otherwise

### Calendar

<a id="1528910942" href="#1528910942">#</a> [Ed Bice] *+1 to that Sandro - pushing against credentialing bodies*

<a id="1528910967" href="#1528910967">#</a> [Scott Yates] *Arkady Babchenko https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/world/europe/ukraine-arkady-babchenko.html*

<a id="1528910985" href="#1528910985">#</a> [Jon Udell] *(I'll be on vacation next Weds.)*

<a id="1528911209" href="#1528911209">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: Misinfocon (in August) open for registration, it's in DC

<a id="1528911274" href="#1528911274">#</a> [An Xiao Mina] *Also: MisinfoCon Research into Action on July 9 in NYC -- if you are a researcher interested in this, please let me know. we won't have as much of a public facing event listing, as it will be a smaller event.*

<a id="1528911298" href="#1528911298">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: AEJMC overlaps in DC, possible cross-pollination?

<a id="1528911316" href="#1528911316">#</a> [Jon Udell] *http://www.aejmc.org/*

<a id="1528911359" href="#1528911359">#</a> [Ed Summers] *Re: "" -- quote
@**Ed Summers** : I gave a lightning talk
*

<a id="1528911380" href="#1528911380">#</a> [Ed Bice] *I have to jump off - thx all.*

<a id="1528911401" href="#1528911401">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: Jane Elizabeth (American Press Institute, https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/) is a point of contact. (@**Jon Udell** is in touch with her as well.)

<a id="1528911514" href="#1528911514">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: , re: July F2F, awaiting confirmation of hosting offers (Facebook, AirBnB)

<a id="1528911661" href="#1528911661">#</a> **sam boyer** says: (re: a possible hackathon), works best when tighty focused. Some aspects of what we do qualify, others not.

<a id="1528911686" href="#1528911686">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: "What's the most hackathon-ready opportunity?"

### July F2F planning

<a id="1528911969" href="#1528911969">#</a> **David Karger** says: , re: a hackathon, is it maybe a design exercise more than a coding exercise

<a id="1528912006" href="#1528912006">#</a> **sam boyer** says: doing that around viewing reputation or claim review sounds interesting

<a id="1528912035" href="#1528912035">#</a> **Reto Gmür** says: we need to do more planning / standardization first

<a id="1528912131" href="#1528912131">#</a> **Jon Udell** says: useful exercise to document how claimreview is used in practice, and how it's so shoddy, document its failings -- missing target URLs, various pathologies

<a id="1528912262" href="#1528912262">#</a> **David Karger** says: a useful design exercise: illustrate how we want our feeds to convey credibility signals

<a id="1528912312" href="#1528912312">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: we use the analogy of nutrition labels, makes you think, we list carbohydrates, do people know what means?

<a id="1528912342" href="#1528912342">#</a> **David Karger** says: nutrition labels are one of many approaches to evaluate in a design exercise

<a id="1528912403" href="#1528912403">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: , would be nice if there were existing datasets so some folks could do paper design, others make prototypes driven by real data

<a id="1528912429" href="#1528912429">#</a> **sam boyer** says: need to provide prompts, some raw material to work from

<a id="1528912559" href="#1528912559">#</a> **sam boyer** says: , having a set of worked-through design concepts seems valuable

### Intros

<a id="1528912630" href="#1528912630">#</a> [Jon Udell] *Mainly for the benefit of @**Ting Cai** who's new to the meeting.*

<a id="1528913100" href="#1528913100">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *Attending July 26-27*

<a id="1528913132" href="#1528913132">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *+1 Ting*

<a id="1528913157" href="#1528913157">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *+1 Reto*

<a id="1528913404" href="#1528913404">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: , w/respect to F2F, fine to talk about long-term vision but let's do something that delivers near-term value.

<a id="1528913485" href="#1528913485">#</a> **Reto Gmür** says: that in the reputation/transparency realm, there aren't the same near-term opportunities as w/respect to inspection and fact--checking/claim review

<a id="1528913632" href="#1528913632">#</a> **Scott Yates** says: whether/how to divide into subgroups depends on whether they'll have critical mass, which is unclear at the moment

<a id="1528913652" href="#1528913652">#</a> **Scott Yates** says: , accordingly, we may need to evangelize this group

<a id="1528913803" href="#1528913803">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: the inspection subgroup, chaired by @**An Xiao Mina**, went well the past 2 weeks.

### Inspection subgroup

<a id="1528913967" href="#1528913967">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: we dove into related indicators, initial study looked at "aggressive" calls to action for social sharing, how do we define "aggressive"?

<a id="1528913998" href="#1528913998">#</a> ... also looking at whether a domain has ads.txt

<a id="1528914039" href="#1528914039">#</a> ...also looking at emotional language, emotionally-charged tone

<a id="1528914097" href="#1528914097">#</a> [Jon Udell] *https://iabtechlab.com/ads-txt/*

<a id="1528914148" href="#1528914148">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *http://www.nytimes.com/ads.txt  fascinating*

<a id="1528914150" href="#1528914150">#</a> **Scott Yates** says: ads.txt is a system to verify which platforms a publisher is using to monetize, disreputable publishers don't have an ads.txt because .. ? .. kind of unclear

<a id="1528914188" href="#1528914188">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *http://www.cnn.com/ads.txt pretty big!*

<a id="1528914320" href="#1528914320">#</a> [Scott Yates] *https://iabtechlab.com/ads.txt/*

<a id="1528914390" href="#1528914390">#</a> [Scott Yates] *Check this one out! https://www.9news.com/ads.txt (this is the NBC affiliate in Denver)*

<a id="1528914402" href="#1528914402">#</a> [Jon Udell] *Comparing http://www.nytimes.com/ads.txt and https://www.washingtonpost.com/ads.txt I find:

appnexus.com, 3661, DIRECT

and 

appnexus.com, 7466, DIRECT

This suggest to me that participating publishers are declaring the identifiers they use to represent themselves in various adtech networks.*
