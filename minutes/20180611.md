<a id="1528733732" href="#1528733732">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: one of the weak points of credibility coalition is understanding how advertising works

<a id="1528733776" href="#1528733776">#</a> .. mere quantity of ads does not correlate with credibility

<a id="1528733888" href="#1528733888">#</a> .. instead, one of the elements that seemed to play a role is the aggressiveness of ads, like pop-ups, or the request to readers to share the content on social media

<a id="1528733941" href="#1528733941">#</a> .. also the language in the text emphasizing requests for sharing is perceived as a relevant indicator for aggressiveness (and credibility)

<a id="1528734188" href="#1528734188">#</a> **Owen Ambur** says: the use of the work "fight" can be an indicator of polarisation

<a id="1528734340" href="#1528734340">#</a> **connie moon sehat** says: there might be an intersection here with other topics that use similar tones ad that call people to action

<a id="1528734373" href="#1528734373">#</a> .. engaging people in a larger arena: not necessarily "fight" but also "combating"

<a id="1528734405" href="#1528734405">#</a> .. there is a subtle division between call to to action, self-promotion, and ads

<a id="1528734463" href="#1528734463">#</a> **Owen Ambur** says: it is a matter of balance

<a id="1528734555" href="#1528734555">#</a> **connie moon sehat** says: when you start moving to the activist side that seems to be when you start to invoke emotionally charge

<a id="1528734594" href="#1528734594">#</a> **Owen Ambur** says: it seems that a lot of marketing is based on emotions rather than on utility

<a id="1528734652" href="#1528734652">#</a> **connie moon sehat** says: at Oxford Internet Group they are looking at how propaganda intersects with advertising

<a id="1528734727" href="#1528734727">#</a> .. one thing is having ads in your page, another is having an article promoting a movement

<a id="1528734755" href="#1528734755">#</a> .. or maybe the question is what is the difference

<a id="1528734783" href="#1528734783">#</a> **Owen Ambur** says: maybe the difference is the appealing to emotions or the fact that something is factual

<a id="1528734806" href="#1528734806">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: I think we are extending from emotions to actions, beyond the text

<a id="1528734850" href="#1528734850">#</a> **Owen Ambur** says: in the political realm voters don't find detailed plans in candidates websites

<a id="1528734887" href="#1528734887">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: some of the article they were assessing look like marketing

<a id="1528734927" href="#1528734927">#</a> **Owen Ambur** says: the health domain is interesting because this is where the connection between reality and emotions takes place

<a id="1528734955" href="#1528734955">#</a> **connie moon sehat** says: the presence of an ad is easy to check, and then you can decide how aggressive it is

<a id="1528734974" href="#1528734974">#</a> .. then you can check if there are calls to action in the article

<a id="1528734996" href="#1528734996">#</a> .. if there is a specific call to action it might worth nothing

<a id="1528735027" href="#1528735027">#</a> .. then we might look at the specific kind of call and maybe define a taxonomy, but the fact that it is present is worth nothing

<a id="1528735092" href="#1528735092">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: in some sources there is an engineering of reality in the content itself through calls for action

<a id="1528735146" href="#1528735146">#</a> **Owen Ambur** says: there should be a distinction between a call for action and advertising

<a id="1528735192" href="#1528735192">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: that the types of ads should be considered, their aggressiveness, their patterns

<a id="1528735222" href="#1528735222">#</a> **Scott Yates** says: the correlation is interesting. Sometimes reputable sites have annoying ads

<a id="1528735233" href="#1528735233">#</a> .. sometimes publishers don't have control over ads

<a id="1528735271" href="#1528735271">#</a> .. I'd be nice to say that if a thing pops over 12 times it becomes an indicator

<a id="1528735302" href="#1528735302">#</a> .. there are small publishers doing a good job but due to the mechanisms in place they rely on annoying ads

<a id="1528735341" href="#1528735341">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: financially motivated misinformation is basically selling clicks

<a id="1528735413" href="#1528735413">#</a> **Scott Yates** says: third party certification might be useful to address this issue

<a id="1528735484" href="#1528735484">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: in the vocabulary we are trying to articulate the security risk

<a id="1528735536" href="#1528735536">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: could content recommendation boxes be good indicators?

<a id="1528735578" href="#1528735578">#</a> **Scott Yates** says: the problem of blacklists is that new sites appear very quickly

<a id="1528735615" href="#1528735615">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: the most productive thing to do seems to distinguish between content and ads

<a id="1528735674" href="#1528735674">#</a> .. is thinking to classify the different types of ads

<a id="1528735747" href="#1528735747">#</a> .. is setting up another study soon with 30-50 articles

<a id="1528735953" href="#1528735953">#</a> [An Xiao Mina] *thank you @**Davide Ceolin** ! :pray:*
