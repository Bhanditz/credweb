### Minutes

<a id="1530529804" href="#1530529804">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *Agenda-ish https://credweb.org/agenda/20180702.html*

<a id="1530547068" href="#1530547068">#</a> [An Xiao Mina] *For our meeting: https://credweb.org/cciv/*

<a id="1530547691" href="#1530547691">#</a> .. minutes seem to be missing some named indicators

<a id="1530547698" href="#1530547698">#</a> .. I'll add before we approve

<a id="1530547718" href="#1530547718">#</a> .. contains ads.txt, group agreed it's useful being so nascent

<a id="1530547728" href="#1530547728">#</a> .. credco study will use that

<a id="1530547744" href="#1530547744">#</a> .. aggressive social shares, distinct from aggressive ads,

<a id="1530547756" href="#1530547756">#</a> .. example: in body content

<a id="1530547775" href="#1530547775">#</a> .. finally: agressive ads, popups, follow-mouse, full-screen

<a id="1530547786" href="#1530547786">#</a> .. maybe not most useful but worth studying

### update on credco

<a id="1530547896" href="#1530547896">#</a> .. this week we're kicking off the credco study

<a id="1530547903" href="#1530547903">#</a> .. 30-50 article

<a id="1530547926" href="#1530547926">#</a> .. ad indicators, citation indicttors, and som eothers out of consultation

<a id="1530547932" href="#1530547932">#</a> .. 6 annotators

<a id="1530547944" href="#1530547944">#</a> .. get more sense of annotation issues

<a id="1530547955" href="#1530547955">#</a> .. Q: what constitutes scientific validation?

<a id="1530547973" href="#1530547973">#</a> .. we'll be correlating indicators for gold std, and IRR

<a id="1530547984" href="#1530547984">#</a> .. but we haven't discussed what the bar should be, as a community

<a id="1530548004" href="#1530548004">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: my sense is that it depends on what one is going to do with it

<a id="1530548062" href="#1530548062">#</a> .. nobody would claim these indicators are going to tell you with high confidence that a random article is true or not. they're validated for a particular kind of article, and even then - what would we do with an indicator that crosses bar?

<a id="1530548142" href="#1530548142">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: I'm inclined to keep a confidence score with each indicator. Not sure each indicator could go beyond that, i.e., one that tells you with high levels of confidence

<a id="1530548264" href="#1530548264">#</a> **Davide Ceolin** says: There should also be confidence score...   some indicators are much more deterministic, easier to compute -- like presence of ads.txt -- but eval aggressiveness of document, that's much more vague.   So level of confidence within the indicator.

<a id="1530548296" href="#1530548296">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: I think that shows in the IRR

<a id="1530548331" href="#1530548331">#</a> **Davide Ceolin** says: The strength in an indicator might show in how it plays with other indicators

<a id="1530548388" href="#1530548388">#</a> .. I think that would need a bigger data set

<a id="1530548461" href="#1530548461">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: sounds like IRR validates each, but relation to truth might not be visible as a solo indicator

<a id="1530548490" href="#1530548490">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: even if individual studies don't show results, later studies on same data might pull things out

<a id="1530548607" href="#1530548607">#</a> .. and different table when we get more studies, eventually

<a id="1530548656" href="#1530548656">#</a> .. for ads.txt we're not using humans, so no real IRR

<a id="1530548781" href="#1530548781">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: I cant think of strong reasons to do it one way or another. Might be good to note if an indicator requires no human judgment.

<a id="1530548796" href="#1530548796">#</a> .. for a yes/no question and all humans agree, IRR = 1. But that's different from having machines test

<a id="1530548857" href="#1530548857">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: : some things machine be machine checkable, like emotional tone.

<a id="1530548929" href="#1530548929">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: I think Easy-Machine-Check is different from this ML-type checking which we'll have more and more of

### inbound links

<a id="1530548999" href="#1530548999">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: subset of extrinsic indicators

<a id="1530549012" href="#1530549012">#</a> .. things that require stepping outside the content

<a id="1530549031" href="#1530549031">#</a> .. previously we talked about how theoretically they are more difficult to game

<a id="1530549042" href="#1530549042">#</a> .. requires link-farm type techniques to game

<a id="1530549063" href="#1530549063">#</a> .. fact-check-by-IFCN member, but hard to check

<a id="1530549085" href="#1530549085">#</a> .. want to go beyond IFCN

<a id="1530549093" href="#1530549093">#</a> .. eg CDC makes assessment

<a id="1530549110" href="#1530549110">#</a> .. looking for broader typology of inbound links

<a id="1530549121" href="#1530549121">#</a> [An Xiao Mina] *https://credweb.org/cciv/#inbound-references*

<a id="1530549194" href="#1530549194">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: for intrinsic indicators, we could theoretically train systems to detect these over time

<a id="1530549214" href="#1530549214">#</a> .. a fact check out there is a completely different game - it's a matter of determining if content makes the same claim as a fact check

<a id="1530549227" href="#1530549227">#</a> .. computational linguistics challenge, not a machine learning thing

<a id="1530549246" href="#1530549246">#</a> .. wouldn't expect results to be feeding into weighting algorithm in nearly the same way, weight on this would be so much higher than other kinds of indicators

<a id="1530549292" href="#1530549292">#</a> .. you could align a claimreview with a source that's trusted

<a id="1530549420" href="#1530549420">#</a> .. IIUC, FB uses claim data from partners, and Google doesnt exactly use IFCN. they have their own computation about whether a site is reliable. will accept claimreview from non IFCN members in theory. not saying IFCN is exactly the gold standard. very high signal into legitimacy

<a id="1530549576" href="#1530549576">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: I can see how some of this might fall under area-2, under claims

<a id="1530549599" href="#1530549599">#</a> .. is it about Claims, or all inbound

<a id="1530549654" href="#1530549654">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: : I think only Claims go into Area-2, and inbound links from wikipedia go in Area-3 Reputation

<a id="1530549687" href="#1530549687">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: that's a thing you could code up

<a id="1530549781" href="#1530549781">#</a> .. inbound links for domains, as well as pages

<a id="1530549820" href="#1530549820">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: this sounds like reputation logic

<a id="1530549838" href="#1530549838">#</a> .. the kind of code you'd use, not human readers

<a id="1530549941" href="#1530549941">#</a> .. are there extrinsic indicators you do want to have the reviews look at?

<a id="1530549974" href="#1530549974">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: Verdict from FC website, or Verdict from high reputation source, where students manually go look

<a id="1530549994" href="#1530549994">#</a> .. ratio of comments to likes (on facebook), linkes from social media, links from other news sites, FB shares and engagements

<a id="1530550031" href="#1530550031">#</a> .. not likely to ask students to do, more automation-friendly

<a id="1530550036" href="#1530550036">#</a> .. also FB comment sentiment

<a id="1530550068" href="#1530550068">#</a> **Davide Ceolin** says: how sources refer to other sources, inbound links might be positive or negative mention, sentiment of the mention

<a id="1530550130" href="#1530550130">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: could be done with human reviewers seeing a snip of the mention; maybe sentiment analysis code is good enough

<a id="1530550167" href="#1530550167">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: of course on twitter as a human I can't tell what's sarcastic

<a id="1530550178" href="#1530550178">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: there is literature around this

<a id="1530550196" href="#1530550196">#</a> .. is this under reputation?

<a id="1530550283" href="#1530550283">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: The conversation around an article, vs the conversation about a source

<a id="1530550292" href="#1530550292">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: not exactly reputation. if one of my friends says the NYT sucks, that's clearly reputation. if someone says an article in the NYT sucks, that's not really reputation

<a id="1530550309" href="#1530550309">#</a> .. just one inbound link with content about it, analysis of an article, that's complicated

<a id="1530550397" href="#1530550397">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: : maybe this is another area, because it's hugely useful, but doesn't exactly line up with existing articles

<a id="1530550415" href="#1530550415">#</a> **An Xiao Mina** says: : Maybe this is another credco study

<a id="1530550521" href="#1530550521">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: some kind of study where you show ten tweets linking to article

<a id="1530550570" href="#1530550570">#</a> .. my sense is given rep of twitter feeds that'd be good

<a id="1530550709" href="#1530550709">#</a> .. sounds like some inbound belongs more the ClaimReview

<a id="1530550716" href="#1530550716">#</a> .. some about reputation

<a id="1530550726" href="#1530550726">#</a> .. and one that could be a good study

### future meetings

<a id="1530550803" href="#1530550803">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *no Monday meeting next week, conflict, but week after is good*

<a id="1530550830" href="#1530550830">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: thinking about scoping of this meeting as Area 1 meeting

<a id="1530550905" href="#1530550905">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *so 2 weeks, Monday, go through other Intrinsic indicators and think about them as a group*

<a id="1530550930" href="#1530550930">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *adjourned*

<a id="1531328857" href="#1531328857">#</a> [Cheryl Langdon-Orr] *Present +*
