<a id="1531758543" href="#1531758543">#</a> .. footnotes, endnotes, links

<a id="1531758550" href="#1531758550">#</a> .. reputation of the things you're linking to

<a id="1531758578" href="#1531758578">#</a> .. credco started with indicators for health & climate -- science topics

<a id="1531758588" href="#1531758588">#</a> .. in breaking news this might be completely different or not apply

<a id="1531758631" href="#1531758631">#</a> .. esp when tweet is deleted, then what to trust

<a id="1531758651" href="#1531758651">#</a> .. the ones we tests in CredCo

<a id="1531758672" href="#1531758672">#</a> .. we looked at the articles cited, how Representative are they of the science article being references

<a id="1531758689" href="#1531758689">#</a> .. are you quoting an outside expert in the field? a best practice in journalism

<a id="1531758703" href="#1531758703">#</a> .. looking at Impact Factor of journal linked-to

<a id="1531758727" href="#1531758727">#</a> .. IF is very roughly measure of value/influence in the field

<a id="1531758765" href="#1531758765">#</a> .. Sentiment

<a id="1531758789" href="#1531758789">#</a> .. So yes, Tone of Citation would be good

<a id="1531758835" href="#1531758835">#</a> .. but we need to look at when there is disagreement in the field

<a id="1531758846" href="#1531758846">#</a> .. gets back to question about relational indicators

<a id="1531758854" href="#1531758854">#</a> .. and emotion indicators

<a id="1531758863" href="#1531758863">#</a> .. tying that together would be good

<a id="1531758949" href="#1531758949">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *now going one at a time.*

<a id="1531758956" href="#1531758956">#</a> .. 1 Source Types

<a id="1531758965" href="#1531758965">#</a> .. could be built out more for more nuance

<a id="1531759024" href="#1531759024">#</a> .. per citation -- we asked them to look at 3

<a id="1531759045" href="#1531759045">#</a> .. didnt correlate

<a id="1531759147" href="#1531759147">#</a> .. not in WebConf paper

<a id="1531759161" href="#1531759161">#</a> .. not sophisitcated yet

<a id="1531759183" href="#1531759183">#</a> .. Like good practice in science reporting, to quote people from outside

<a id="1531759199" href="#1531759199">#</a> .. Obviously quotes could be fabricated

<a id="1531759303" href="#1531759303">#</a> .. ideally the conversation happens EG on Twitter

<a id="1531759328" href="#1531759328">#</a> .. you want to link to the quote In Context and Endorsed by quoted person

<a id="1531759368" href="#1531759368">#</a> .. ideally

<a id="1531759394" href="#1531759394">#</a> .. I think it was a group in Canada

<a id="1531759431" href="#1531759431">#</a> .. Number of quoted sources, Number of links

<a id="1531759440" href="#1531759440">#</a> .. just seeing if sheer number is interesting

<a id="1531759447" href="#1531759447">#</a> .. like Number of ads.

<a id="1531759533" href="#1531759533">#</a> .. I don't recall the story here

<a id="1531759564" href="#1531759564">#</a> .. 9.7 Contains original quotes

<a id="1531759602" href="#1531759602">#</a> .. Not in WebConf, although it seemed promising.

<a id="1531759638" href="#1531759638">#</a> .. not from the study

<a id="1531759646" href="#1531759646">#</a> .. related/overlapping with 9.2 and 9.3

<a id="1531759712" href="#1531759712">#</a> .. not necessarily a quote

<a id="1531759740" href="#1531759740">#</a> .. like a statement they refused to comment   :-)

<a id="1531759766" href="#1531759766">#</a> .. 9.8 Contains Video Embeds

<a id="1531759790" href="#1531759790">#</a> .. 9.10 Contains Image Macros

<a id="1531759796" href="#1531759796">#</a> .. 9.11 Contains Attributed images

<a id="1531759803" href="#1531759803">#</a> .. 9.12 Contain Original Images

<a id="1531759812" href="#1531759812">#</a> .. all about embedding visual content

<a id="1531759838" href="#1531759838">#</a> .. intuition is that these will be positively correlated, but we didn't study this yet

<a id="1531759855" href="#1531759855">#</a> .. might be different if embed is extract from study, or something else

<a id="1531759866" href="#1531759866">#</a> .. 9.9 Contains Link to Scientific Journals

<a id="1531759880" href="#1531759880">#</a> .. we did study this

<a id="1531759889" href="#1531759889">#</a> .. (not sure offhand the result)

<a id="1531759901" href="#1531759901">#</a> .. but related to 9.14 Represtation, which we did

<a id="1531759926" href="#1531759926">#</a> .. 9.13 Agencies for Authority

<a id="1531759939" href="#1531759939">#</a> .. not sure who the "I" is, probably folks into 9.1 source types

<a id="1531759948" href="#1531759948">#</a> .. eg CDC is authoritatinve agency

<a id="1531759979" href="#1531759979">#</a> .. related to eg IFCN inbound links

<a id="1531759998" href="#1531759998">#</a> .. Idea is - you have reputable agencies that are not eg IFCN members

<a id="1531760126" href="#1531760126">#</a> .. contains (embedded) content

<a id="1531760162" href="#1531760162">#</a> .. 9.14 Accuracy of representation of source article

<a id="1531760171" href="#1531760171">#</a> .. more in detail

<a id="1531760225" href="#1531760225">#</a> **Sandro Hawke** says: : Citations - this whole topic - in general, negative references are different. But mostly we're talking about borrowing authority. YOu want to say something credible so you point to someone else saying the same thing.

<a id="1531760336" href="#1531760336">#</a> .. all of these seem to have some reputation element -- your reputation depends a bit on the reputation of who you cite

<a id="1531760370" href="#1531760370">#</a> .. 9.15 Academic Journal Impact Factor

<a id="1531760387" href="#1531760387">#</a> .. this was an explicit reputation representation

<a id="1531760402" href="#1531760402">#</a> .. Mike Caulfield has his students do something like this, checking on Google Scholar

<a id="1531760421" href="#1531760421">#</a> .. I.F. isn't perfect, but something like this seems machine-doable

<a id="1531760460" href="#1531760460">#</a> .. that works for your outside metrics

<a id="1531760525" href="#1531760525">#</a> [Sandro Hawke] *https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3iUAjSsAAAAJ*

<a id="1531760562" href="#1531760562">#</a> [An Xiao Mina] *https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z2UUZSkAAAAJ&hl=en*

<a id="1531760644" href="#1531760644">#</a> .. so calling someone an expert in the field without an h-index at least 10 would be silly

<a id="1531760659" href="#1531760659">#</a> .. you can look at the top 1% by hIndex in each field

<a id="1531760853" href="#1531760853">#</a> .. but cancel next week given F2F
