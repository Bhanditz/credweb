    <h1 id="h.hoc6clg2vmn6">Introduction</h1>
    <p>Can you tell, when you&apos;re looking at a random web page, whether you should trust it? When scanning a page of reviews or search results, do you know which matches come from legitimate sources and which are scams? When reading a news feed, can you tell which items ought to be believed and which are slanted, manipulative, propaganda, or outright lies? Perhaps most importantly, what happens when you inevitably guess wrong while making some of these credibility assessments, and you unknowingly share falsehoods to your community, helping to make them viral? What if you are misled into making bad decisions&#xA0;for yourself and the people you care about, with potentially disastrous consequences? </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://credweb.org&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537816495500000">Credible Web Community Group</a>&#xA0;formed at W3C, the organization which develops technical standards for the web, to look for technological solutions for this &#x201C;credibility assessment&#x201D; problem. It&apos;s not that we think tech can solve every problem, especially ones as deeply human and complex as this one, but it seems likely that some tech is making matters worse and that other designs could probably serve people better. For some of us, creating better approaches to credibility assessment seems like a good way to help.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h1 id="h.rcs17hj6bu6r">Scope</h1>
    <p>This report, like the Community Group which developed it, is focused on web-centric technical solutions which require standardization.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The web isn&apos;t everything but it&apos;s arguably the knowledge backbone of the world today. &#xA0;Everything can and usually does tie back to the web to some degree, so if the web is a reliable source of accuracy, that should help quite a bit.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Data interchange vocabularies are the likely main area to standardize. See below, <a href="#h.wpcxeg3cugmx">Potential New Web Standards</a>. Browser functionality is another possibility, but the bar is much higher, and few of the current proposals require that to function, although it would certainly help with deployment.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>While this report is forward-looking, some of the technologies discussed are already deployed to some degree in existing systems, particular where they require no user action, like in prioritizing search results and news feed items. The hope here is to make such systems more accurate and effective by providing them better data, standardized, from around the web.</p>

    <h1 id="h.bjkr6l1byyj4">First, Do No Harm: Hazards of Intervention</h1>
    <p>Changing the technology of the web to empower users to be more accurately informed, while likely to be difficult, sounds laudable and even overdue. But there are likely to be unintended consequences of these changes. To use a medical analogy, treatments used to help address this painful condition are likely to have side-effects. That doesn&#x2019;t mean we can afford to do nothing, which itself presents a significant risk, but we do need to proceed with caution.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This section lists types of side effects, with some ideas about how to mitigate the risks. A general approach to managing these is discussed later, as a recommendations, in <a href="#h.vcnrv18hbkbk">11.1. Review Board Process</a>.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In general, this should be understood in the context of W3C&#x2019;s mission of a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537816495503000">Web for All, a Web for Rich Interaction, and a Web of Trust</a>. There may need to be trade-offs between benefits of the web; if so, let&#x2019;s make them with our eyes open.&#xA0;</p>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.al8ri09fk7mb">Censorship</h2>
        <p>The regulation of content, called &quot;censorship&quot; in some contexts, is controversial. Nearly every country in the world considers publication of certain kinds of material (such as child pornography) immoral and illegal. &#xA0;At the same time, many of the same countries express the value of free speech and a free press, sometimes in very broad language. In practice, there is rarely a bright line between content to be prohibited and content to be tolerated. Additionally, content that falls on one side of the line in one jurisdiction at one point in time might be on the other side of the line in a different jurisdiction or at a different time. Meanwhile, the web reaches across time and jurisdiction.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Historically, and perhaps largely by accident of design, the web has managed this controversy by making it relatively easy for anyone to publish what they want but also making it hard to run a website while being anonymous to law enforcement. Given the current technology, much of the world&#x2019;s population could easily set up a website hosting illegal content. But the same technology makes it fairly easy to track such a person down and, subject to applicable laws, take down the site and/or identify them for criminal prosecution. There are technologies which allow sites to be more anonymous, but they are vastly more difficult to use, making them prohibitive for most situations. (This web-technology compromise should not be confused with content regulation decisions made within a particular platform, which is a separate issue.)</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>While some people are uncomfortable with this technology-driven compromise, especially when considering content they would place on the other side of line from where it currently lies, we suggest that extreme care be taken before sweeping this solution aside for something that might be worse.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Some proposed credibility technologies could upset the current balance. For example, one common suggestion is to allow publishers to be certified as adhering to certain standards. Platforms would then be free to use this certification to provide better services, although they might also be pressured, perhaps by liability concerns. Schemes like this could significantly raise the bar on publication, fundamentally changing the balance in the system. It should not&#xA0;be done lightly.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It may make sense to raise the bar in certain limited ways. &#xA0;For example, in professions and industries which are already regulated, like medicine, making existing certifications available to the computing infrastructure could increase the quality of information with relatively limited side-effects. &#xA0;Even then, some &#x201C;escape hatch&#x201D; mechanism would likely be important, where people who fail to meet that test can still get word out (eg as a whistle-blower), perhaps via a trusted third party or an opt-in system of bypassing the safety mechanism. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.qayku97gyi0m">Centralization</h2>
        <p>Another possible area of side-effects is in shifting the web toward having more centralized control. For example, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999367582271422464&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537816495505000">Elon Musk&#x2019;s &#x201C;Pravda&#x201D; proposal</a>&#xA0;to &#x201C;create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication&#x201D; may (or may not) have been tongue-in-cheek, but it received massive coverage and support. Such a system would have strong network effects, likely resulting in a monopoly power in its niche if it caught on. As such, despite whatever value it might bring it its users in the short term, it would stifle competition and free innovation. It would also introduce critical issues with scaling, censorship, and political bias.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In contrast, the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-webarch-20041215/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537816495506000">architecture of the web</a>&#xA0;is largely decentralized, minimizing bottlenecks and central points of control. &#xA0;With this in mind, and with the will to do so, something like &#x201C;Pravda&#x201D; could potentially be created as a decentralized system, using <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization%23Technological_decentralization&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537816495507000">a variety of techniques</a>&#xA0;including <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537816495507000">W3C ActivityPub</a>.&#xA0;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>More modestly, and as a general rule, we suggest that whatever systems are implemented to help with credibility, the end-user always retain final control over their data and their computing platform. This aligns with our recommended approach of standardizing vocabularies for credibility data interchange, removing the technological barriers to moving data between systems.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>We recognize that some degree of centralization, while it has risks, can have tremendous value and may turn out to be worthwhile. For example, the increased centralization of email has likely helped with reducing the problem of spam. Still, independent email systems exist and interoperate. </p>
        <p></p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.ii67vp7vvjhg">Tribalism, Echo Chambers, Filter Bubbles</h2>
        <p>Some proposals are likely to increase the degree to which consumers see only the content they want to see or their community wants them to see, regardless of its accuracy. While generally viewed as a bad thing, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://twitter.com/rasmus_kleis/status/1014071175415246848&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537816495508000">experts disagree</a>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>One theory on addressing this is to make clear to users when they are inside their bubble (their personal walled garden) and to allow them to easily step outside of it, whenever they want. The theory is that people won&#x2019;t always choose to be sheltered, but will instead sometimes be looking for adventure, or something, &#x201C;outside the wall&#x201D;. &#xA0; One early tool for &#x201C;stepping outside&#x201D; is &#xA0;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537816495509000">Blue Feed, Red Feed</a>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It has also been suggested that prediction markets incentivize accurate broad knowledge, leading people outside their bubbles, and that commerce/trade in general motivates people to connect between &#x201C;tribes&#x201D; and help people get along regardless of &#x201C;tribe&#x201D;.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.ygjgm6xcaohr">Privacy</h2>
        <p>Some credibility solutions may impact privacy. For example, a browser plug-in which checks every page the user visits using its proprietary cloud-based service could potentially misuse or leak information. If architected without due safety measures, it could easy leak private URLs the user visits, and in some cases could even leak secret page contents, such as the user&#x2019;s medical communications&#xA0;and their employer&#x2019;s proprietary data, when accessed via the browser.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.erwe81uzigvy">Other Unintended consequences</h2>
        <p>It can be hard to predict all the ways a technological intervention can go wrong. For example, Facebook reported that adding warnings to newsfeed items indicating when an item had been debunked by fact-checkers resulted in more people reading and spreading false news. Predicting, detecting, and if necessary changing course away from such effects can be even harder in standardized, multi-vendor, decentralized systems.</p>
        <p></p>

    <h1 id="h.v8boqqhafijm">Terminology</h1>
    <p>In this document we have attempted to use terms consistently and precisely, hoping to help promote wider consensus on terminology for the field. We are being both descriptive and a bit prescriptive here, although we recognize that better terms may emerge and supplant these.</p>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.qb3xsvjmme10">Trust and Credibility</h2>
        <p>Information is <b>trustworthy</b>&#xA0;if you can use it making&#xA0;decisions which guide your actions (that is, you can <b>trust</b>&#xA0;it) without being misled or deceived. This often becomes clear only in retrospect, and even in hindsight it&#x2019;s possible to be deceived about what actually happened. &#xA0;In the present, when one needs to make decisions using uncertain information, the best one can do is make an educated guess about whether information is trustworthy. &#xA0;Equivalently, being trustworthy means being &#x201C;<b>true</b>&#xA0;enough&#x201D; or &#x201C;<b>accurate</b>&#xA0;enough&#x201D; for some course of action being considered.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The <b>credibility</b>&#xA0;of information is the probability that it is trustworthy. Often this probability is not well known, and people speak about it in broad relative terms. &#xA0;We use the term <b>credibility score</b>&#xA0;when necessary to clarify we mean a numeric 0-to-1 (or 0-100%) probability value. The precise semantics of this score remain to be determined.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>We say information is <b>credible</b>&#xA0;or <b>has high credibility</b>&#xA0;if it&apos;s credibility is high enough, in a given situation, that a decision maker is willing to trust it, to act as if it is true. In contrast, we say information is <b>not credible</b>&#xA0;or <b>has low credibility</b>&#xA0;if its credibility is not high enough to proceed as if it is true. Implicit in this terminology is a <b>credibility cut-off</b>&#xA0;level, the credibility score a given decision maker requires in a given context to consider the information in question worthy of trust. &#xA0;</p>
        <p><b></b></p>
        <p><b>Credibility assessment</b>&#xA0;(by analogy to &#x201C;risk assessment&#x201D;) is the process of making a determination, often with great uncertainty, whether information is trustworthy. &#xA0;This process typically results in a binary yes/no decision in people. For machines, a numeric credibility level can often be produced, although determining a scale to allow comparison across systems0 remains as future work.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.43d5m1wbjs7u">Roles in a Credibility Ecosystem</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>&#xA0;A single party may play multiple roles in the flow of a single news item.</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul><li>(Content) <b>Consumer</b>: person who is receiving and experiencing some content. &#xA0;Similar to: Audience Member, Reader, Viewer, Listener, Receiver, User</li><li>(Content) <b>Provider</b>: person or organization who provided the consumer with some content. There may be a supply chain of providers, creating and assembling content before it reaches the consumer, and then sometimes a chain of friends who act as provider, passing the content on to each other. Often this is invisible to the consumer, who perceives (and makes credibility assessments about) a single apparent provider. &#xA0;<sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup>Similar to: Producer, Creator, Author, Publisher</li><li>(Content) <b>Promoter</b>: person or organization who intentionally or unintentionally increases the spread of content. In social media platforms, this can be as simple as &#x201C;liking&#x201D;. Commenting on content or linking to it, even to refute it, can increase its spread and visibility due to various algorithms. </li><li>(Credibility) <b>Facilitator</b>: &#xA0;person or organization who is helping the consumer decide what to trust. &#xA0;Similar to: Moderator, Fact-Checker, Forum or Comments Editor.</li><li>(Web-Based Communication) <b>Platform</b>: technological system, and by extension the person or organization who maintains and controls it, which is providing the above parties with the infrastructure which enables the content to pass among them. Often controls which items are allowed and ranks items to influence which are seen. Includes content management systems (CMSs), web browsers, search engines, news feeds&#xA0;(as in social networks and microblogging services), and media sharing platforms.</li></ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.k3a5bxg8k9ru">Inputs for Credibility Assessment</h2>
        <ul><li>(Credibility) <b>signal (for machines)</b>: measurable feature of a content item or related entity (such as its provider) used by computer algorithms in automated credibility assessment</li><li>(Credibility) <b>indicator (for people)</b>: observable feature of a content item or related entity, often added by the platform in the user interface, used by human content consumers in their mental process of credibility assessment</li></ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>This &#x201C;signal&#x201D; vs &#x201C;indicator&#x201D; distinction is only used in some communities. &#xA0;Unless you know it is accepted by your audience, we suggest adding clarifying surrounding words, like &#x201C;credibility signal for machines&#x201D; and &#x201C;credibility indicator for people&#x201D;. &#xA0; (Hopefully we can converge on a common vocabulary soon, unlike in the anglophone automotive world where &#x201C;turn signal&#x201D; and &#x201C;turn indicator&#x201D; are still widely used in different communities.) &#xA0;</p>

    <section>
        <h2 id="h.4nvodw32hqjj">Assessment Strategies: How Can People Tell What To Believe?</h2>
        <p>Techniques for assessing credibility can be grouped roughly into the following four types of strategies. Each of these strategies could be applied with a wide range of computer assistance, and some technologies will likely combine elements of several strategies.</p>
        <p></p>
        <ol start="1"><li><b>Inspection.</b>&#xA0;Look closely at the content (and the page where it appears) for the presence of features which are statistically associated with low or high credibility. The expectation is that most of these features will be reliably detectable using software soon. Inspection may be the primary strategy consumers use unconsciously while reading. The hope is that assessment accuracy can be significantly improved with computer assistance and suitable grounding research.</li><li><b>Corroboration.</b>&#xA0;Identify salient claims made (or implied, or relied upon) in the content and check other sources which offer an assessment of the claim (eg fact-checks), or related claims, or evidence helping the consumer accurately assess the claim. &#xA0;</li><li><b>Reputation.</b>&#xA0;Assess the credibility of a content provider by gathering statements about them from other high-credibility providers. &#xA0;This can be done recursively, forming a reputation network from a few known and trusted &#x201C;root&#x201D; providers to help assess many unknown and suspect ones. &#xA0;</li><li><b>Transparency.</b>&#xA0;Consider what the provider says about themselves and their content. &#xA0;For instance, content may be labeled as opinion or even satire, and providers may label themselves as partisan or having processes and controls the consumer views as untrustworthy. &#xA0;By itself, this data is easy to fake, but coupled with corroboration, reputation, and off-line social and legal incentives, it may be quite effective.</li></ol>
    </section>

<section>
    <h1 id="h.ij0k32jlsndm">Granularity: Which Entities Are You Assessing for Credibility?</h1>
    <p>People necessarily make credibility assessments about content items and about the people who provided the content. It seems likely they make these assessments across a wide range of granularities.</p>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.5uftu3raaxuh">People and Organizations (Content Providers)</h2>
        <p>For example, Harvard University would be large-granularity source, comprising many people over several centuries, but still having some degree of aggregate credibility. &#xA0;In contrast, in considering the credibility of Harvard Professor Jonathan Zittrain, one would be working at a smaller granularity. &#xA0;An even smaller granularity might be Professor Zittrain during a given conversation or on a given topic. &#xA0;For example, he might be much more credible when speaking about issues concerning the Internet and Society than about 12th century French poetry.<sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup></p>

        <h2 id="h.st1avm3jie2h">Content and Claims</h2>
        <p>Reasoning about the&#xA0;credibility of content<sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt7" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup>&#xA0;similarly requires working with a range of granularities.<sup><a href="#cmnt8" id="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt9" id="cmnt_ref9">[i]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt10" id="cmnt_ref10">[j]</a></sup>&#xA0;For example, we might consider the credibility of a snapshot of Wikipedia, or of a particular Wikipedia page, or the text of a paragraph, or a specific claim.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.anvuxde13i6n">Complications due to the Web</h2>
        <p>In general, working with metadata about web content, it often works to design for web pages, then extend the granularity up to origins (loosely, domain names) and down to fragments (loosely, portions of a page or portions of media shown on the page). &#xA0;Note that the Web Annotation framework <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-states/%23json-examples-converted-to-fragment-identifiers&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537816495522000">specifies a way</a>&#xA0;to make essentially any portion of any version of a page be its own addressable fragment, although that is&#xA0;not yet widely implemented.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Sites which aggregate content from other providers, including social media sites, will need special consideration, as will sites which analyze or review other content, sometimes including false content as an example or evidence.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Credibility ratings for a web page may at first seem to be just about whether the <i>content</i>&#xA0;is trustworthy, but in practice websites can change their content or even secretly show different content to different observers, so the trustworthiness<sup><a href="#cmnt11" id="cmnt_ref11">[k]</a></sup>&#xA0;of the site maintainer is a factor as well. For assessments to securely apply to just the intended content of a page and not also include its provider, some mechanism is needed to securely indicate the exact content being considered<sup><a href="#cmnt12" id="cmnt_ref12">[l]</a></sup>. &#xA0;</p>

            <p>Define a way for one provider to embed content from another without endorsement. This would be for credibility a bit like <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537816495578000">nofollow</a>&#xA0;was for SEO. &#xA0;An iframe would be the natural web way to do this, but 3rd party content on social media doesn&#x2019;t currently work that way. There is also the question whether the visited site can be entirely blameless for harmful 3rd party content; perhaps it can embed it with indicators about what editorial/review process it followed, if any.</p>

    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1">[a]</a>Making that chain of provenance explicit and visible would be one important kind of credibility indicator.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref2" id="cmnt2">[b]</a>Good point. &#xA0;Leaving this note here until I&apos;m sure it&apos;s recorded down below.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref3" id="cmnt3">[c]</a>I think it would be helpful for others reading this to describe this in abstract/scalable terms first, then provide the examples as shown. </p><p></p><p>From what I&apos;m reading, it sounds like you&apos;re arguing that credibility of an entity is dependent on the topic at hand (seemingly dependent on their experience with the topic). And furthermore, entities can be individuals or collectives, the latter&apos;s credibility often being some aggregate of its members.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref4" id="cmnt4">[d]</a>I think it&apos;d also be useful to break down the other things that could affect one&apos;s established credibility. For example, the thoroughness of one&apos;s journalism practices could be a better indicator of credibility than experience in some cases.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref5" id="cmnt5">[e]</a>That&apos;s an interesting point. Credibility from authority needs to be based on the subject, but journalists move from subject to subject frequently as they change assignments. Indicators of authority need to be bounded by subject matter, but they also need to be agile enough that they can keep up with a journalist.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref6" id="cmnt6">[f]</a>Is multimedia content (images/videos) and its authenticity and use also in the scope of this work? If yes, it would make sense to include it in the examples that follow.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref7" id="cmnt7">[g]</a>Yes, good idea</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref8" id="cmnt8">[h]</a>This brings up a question in my head: at what point of granularity does one stop considering &quot;credibility&quot; and start considering &quot;validity&quot;? </p><p>To me at least, it seems like credibility deals more with the how people choose to believe (or not believe) the entities you mentioned above.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref9" id="cmnt9">[i]</a>On the other hand, content and claims in a vacuum (without an owner) can either be said to be true or not.</p><p></p><p>...I&apos;m thinking out loud here, though. I could see an argument for such claims to be &quot;credible&quot; by themselves based on certain attributes of their delivery or how well they align with the observer&apos;s worldview. </p><p>Just something to think about.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref10" id="cmnt10">[j]</a>Yeah, i think probably we need a definition/comment about &quot;credibility&quot;, and how it connects to truth, validity, and my favorite term, &quot;accuracy&quot;.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref11" id="cmnt11">[k]</a>trustworthiness or clear practice of publication protocol? &#xA0;also thinking that probably some bloggers and small outfits are trustworthy, but they take advantage of the editorial freedom that online publishing gives them, and dink with texts now and then. &#xA0;(which is why access timedate stamp is part of some citation processes)</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref12" id="cmnt12">[l]</a>And its change history! The Wayback helps in a coarsely granular way. https://twitter.com/nyt_diff does a much more focused thing. But there&apos;s lots of space along the continuum between those extremes.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref13" id="cmnt13">[m]</a>These modes are interesting, I presume they come from general observations. Or has there been some research into this?</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref14" id="cmnt14">[n]</a>I&apos;m hoping someone brings in relevant research but for now, yeah, it&apos;s from thinking about this problem</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref15" id="cmnt15">[o]</a>Like comments sections, this could become an invitation for partisans to troll and express their doubts about viewpoints that differ from theirs, regardless of any evidence presented.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref16" id="cmnt16">[p]</a>the three modes have overlap. for instance, users could choose to turn on filtering/blocking or tweak their personal algorithm to demote certain content. I think there is an assumption that all of these are platform operated but they need not be.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref17" id="cmnt17">[q]</a>It may be possible to &quot;nudge&quot; folks without unduly impinging upon their autonomy. &#xA0;As Thaler &amp; Sunstein have suggested, the key is to ensure that it is easy for them to make another choice if they wish.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref18" id="cmnt18">[r]</a>Is this an &quot;attack&quot; then? Should it be included here? Or, should section 7 be renamed &quot;Influence Models&quot; and then broken down into subsections that reflect increasing degree of threat/attack?</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref19" id="cmnt19">[s]</a>thought the example of zignal labs and stock market price/reputation attack correlation was interesting</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref20" id="cmnt20">[t]</a>This name feels vague and covers some of the other categories. I think it could be split up too - doing it for the lulz is different than inciting harassment out of anger.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref21" id="cmnt21">[u]</a>I was trying to put &quot;doing it for the lulz&quot; into #5, but ... it&apos;d be nice if there was an existing enumeration of this stuff. &#xA0; Agreed this name is lousy.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref22" id="cmnt22">[v]</a>maybe we can lean on FD typology of motivations: https://medium.com/1st-draft/fake-news-its-complicated-d0f773766c79</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref23" id="cmnt23">[w]</a>D&amp;S Report: https://datasociety.net/pubs/oh/DataAndSociety_MediaManipulationAndDisinformationOnline.pdf</p><p></p><p>see language on: &quot;The preservation of ambiguity (Poe&#x2019;s Law: &#x201C;Without a clear indication of the</p><p>author&#x2019;s intent, it is difficult or impossible to tell the difference between an</p><p>expression of sincere extremism and a parody of extremism.&#x201D;16)&quot;</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref24" id="cmnt24">[x]</a>Even engaging in violent behaviour against specific groups of people.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref25" id="cmnt25">[y]</a>making certain people&apos;s lives miserable</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref26" id="cmnt26">[z]</a>Hmmmm. &#xA0; What&apos;s the intended impact there? &#xA0;Like, an intermediate impact is to make them miserable, maybe it&apos;s seen as punishing them, but why? &#xA0; Or is that in practice not knowable. &#xA0;In the case of eg sexism it seems to be about shaping the social order, or something like that.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref27" id="cmnt27">[aa]</a>This section looks good!</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref28" id="cmnt28">[ab]</a>This shifts the trust target from the document to the tool, the signals it extracts, and the user ability to interpret them. We might want to clarify these aspects as well.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref29" id="cmnt29">[ac]</a>Do we want to discuss, here, the platform vs browser dynamic w/respect to how fact-checks are (or can be) found and displayed relative to content?</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref30" id="cmnt30">[ad]</a>today i have been thinking about the efforts to fact-check the fact checkers (observe the observers), which puts things into a bit of a loop -- PolitiFact as making a claim itself, which gets checked by organizations like this reported conservative one https://www.newsbusters.org/fact-checkers (the idea that fact checking is liberal: https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/mar/27/conservative-project-seeks-fact-check-fact-checker/) &#xA0;so thinking a bit about how this looks under both Inspection and Corroboration</p></div>

    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref37" id="cmnt37">[ak]</a>What about Expressing the &quot;credibility history&quot; of a provider (e.g. past verified or debunked posts)? It is somewhat related to bias, but more explicitly linked with a credibility prior.</p></div>
    <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref38" id="cmnt38">[al]</a>That strikes me as more Corroboration -- claims which are verified or debunked -- just with a broader time horizon. &#xA0; That should definitely be added here somewhere. &#xA0;And yeah, as a user, I might expect that to be more about reputation than corroboration. &#xA0;Hrrrrrrrm.</p></div>
