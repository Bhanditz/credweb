    <h1 id="h.hoc6clg2vmn6">Introduction</h1>
    <p>Can you tell, when looking at a random web page, whether you should trust it? When scanning a page of reviews or search results, do you know which matches come from legitimate sources and which are scams? When reading a news feed, can you tell which items ought to be believed and which are slanted or manipulative? Can you detect propaganda or outright lies? Perhaps most importantly, what happens when you inevitably guess wrong while making some of these credibility assessments, and you unknowingly share falsehoods with your community, helping to make them viral? What if you are misled into making bad decisions&#xA0;for yourself and the people you care about, with potentially disastrous consequences? </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://credweb.org&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905883000">Credible Web Community Group</a>&#xA0;was formed at W3C, the organization which develops technical standards for the web, to look for technological solutions for this &#x201C;credibility assessment&#x201D; problem. It&apos;s not that we think technology&#xA0;can solve every problem, especially ones as deeply human and complex as this one, but it seems likely that some technology&#xA0;is making matters worse and that other designs could probably serve people better. For some of us, creating better approaches to credibility assessment seems like a good way to help.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h1 id="h.rcs17hj6bu6r">Scope</h1>
    <p>This report, like the Community Group which developed it, is focused on web-centric technical solutions which require standardization.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The web isn&apos;t everything,&#xA0;but it&apos;s arguably the knowledge backbone of the world today. &#xA0;Everything can and usually does tie back to the web to some degree, so if the web is a reliable source of accurate information, that should help quite a bit.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>With standardization, we can help people (via their computers) work together toward improving credibility assessment and the availability of trustworthy information. &#xA0;As detailed below in <a href="#h.wpcxeg3cugmx">11. Potential New Web Standards</a>, the area we find most suitable for standardization is web data interchange, where websites publish data for other systems to consume. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rdf%23w3c_all&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905885000">W3C standards</a>&#xA0;already cover the basic mechanics for this, and they are widely implemented, most popularly with vocabularies defined by <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://schema.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905885000">schema.org</a>&#xA0;(a group of search engine companies). What remains is to standardize vocabularies (also known as schemas or ontologies) for exchanging data which bears directly on credibility assessment, that is, &#x201C;credibility data&#x201D;.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>There may also be benefit in standardizing new browser functionality. For example, browsers might manage a collection of independent credibility assessment tools which work together to guide and inform the user. This kind of new feature can be pioneered in browser extensions and then later adopted into browsers to increase the user base. &#xA0; </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>While this report is forward-looking, some of the technologies discussed are already deployed to some degree in existing systems, particular where they require no user action, like in prioritizing search results and news feed items. The hope here is to make such systems more accurate and effective by providing them with better data from around the web&#xA0;in a standard format.</p>

    <h1 id="h.bjkr6l1byyj4">First, Do No Harm: Hazards of Intervention</h1>
    <p>Changing the technology of the web to empower users to be more accurately informed, while likely to be difficult, sounds laudable and even overdue. But there are likely to be unintended consequences resulting from these changes. To use a medical analogy, treatments used to help address this painful condition are likely to have side&#xA0;effects. That doesn&#x2019;t mean we can afford to do nothing, which itself presents significant risk, but we do need to proceed with caution.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This section lists types of side effects, with some ideas about how to mitigate the risks. A general approach to managing these is discussed later, as recommendations, in <a href="#h.vcnrv18hbkbk">11.1. Review Board Process</a>.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In general, this should be understood within the context of W3C&#x2019;s mission of a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905887000">Web for All, a Web for Rich Interaction, and a Web of Trust</a>. There may need to be trade-offs between benefits of the web; if so, let&#x2019;s make them with our eyes open.&#xA0;</p>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.al8ri09fk7mb">Censorship</h2>
        <p>The regulation of content, called &quot;censorship&quot; in some contexts, is controversial. Nearly every country in the world considers publication of certain kinds of material (such as child pornography) immoral and illegal. &#xA0;At the same time, many of the same countries express&#xA0;their belief in&#xA0;the value of free speech and a free press, sometimes in very broad language. In practice, there is rarely a sharp line between content that is prohibited and content that is tolerated. Additionally, content that falls on one side of the line in one jurisdiction at one point in time might be on the other side of the line in a different jurisdiction or at a different time. Meanwhile, the web reaches across time and jurisdiction.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Historically, and perhaps largely by accident of design, the web has managed this controversy by making it relatively easy for anyone to publish what they want but also making it hard to run a website while remaining anonymous to law enforcement. Given the current technology, much of the world&#x2019;s population could easily set up a website and host illegal content. But the same technology makes it fairly easy to track such a person down and, subject to applicable laws, take down the site and/or identify the&#xA0;site&#x2019;s owner&#xA0;for criminal prosecution. There are technologies which allow sites to be more anonymous, but they are vastly more difficult to use, making them prohibitive for most situations. (This web&#xA0;technology compromise should not be confused with content regulation decisions made within a particular platform, which is a separate issue.)</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>While some people are uncomfortable with this technology-driven compromise, especially when considering content they would place on the other side of the line from where it currently lies, we suggest that extreme care be taken before sweeping this solution aside for something that might be worse.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Some proposed credibility technologies could upset the current balance. For example, one common suggestion is to allow publishers to be certified as entities which adhere to certain standards. Platforms would then be free to use this certification to provide better services, although they might also be pressured&#xA0;to only allow certified content, perhaps by liability concerns. Approaches&#xA0;like this could significantly raise the bar on publication, fundamentally changing the balance in the system. It should not&#xA0;be done lightly.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It may make sense to raise the bar in certain limited ways. &#xA0;For example, in professions and industries which are already regulated, like medicine, making existing certifications available to the computing infrastructure could increase the quality of information with relatively limited side-effects. &#xA0;Even then, some &#x201C;escape hatch&#x201D; mechanism would likely be important, where people who fail to meet that test can still get word out (e.g.,&#xA0;as a whistle-blower), perhaps via a trusted third-party or an opt-in system for bypassing the safety mechanism. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.qayku97gyi0m">Centralization</h2>
        <p>Another possible area of side-effects is in shifting the web toward having more centralized control. For example, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999367582271422464&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905889000">Elon Musk&#x2019;s &#x201C;Pravda&#x201D; proposal</a>&#xA0;to &#x201C;create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication&#x201D; may (or may not) have been tongue-in-cheek, but it received massive coverage and support. Such a system would have strong network effects, likely resulting in a monopoly power in its niche if it caught on. As such, despite whatever value it might bring to its users in the short term, it would stifle competition and free innovation. It would also introduce critical issues with scaling, censorship, and political bias.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In contrast, the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-webarch-20041215/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905890000">architecture of the web</a>&#xA0;is largely decentralized, minimizing bottlenecks and central points of control. &#xA0;With this in mind, and with the will to do so, something like &#x201C;Pravda&#x201D; could potentially be created as a decentralized system, using <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization%23Technological_decentralization&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905890000">a variety of techniques</a>&#xA0;including the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905890000">W3C ActivityPub</a>&#xA0;protocol.&#xA0;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>More modestly, and as a general rule, we suggest that whatever systems are implemented to help with credibility, the end-user always retain final control over their data and their computing platform. This aligns with our recommended approach of standardizing vocabularies for credibility data interchange, removing the technological barriers to moving data between systems.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>We recognize that some degree of centralization, while it has risks, can have tremendous value and may turn out to be worthwhile. For example, the increased centralization of email has likely helped with reducing the problem of spam. Still, independent email systems exist and interoperate. </p>
        <p></p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.ii67vp7vvjhg">Tribalism, Echo Chambers, Filter Bubbles</h2>
        <p>Some proposals are likely to increase the degree to which consumers see only the content they want to see or their community wants them to see, regardless of its accuracy. While generally viewed as a bad thing, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://twitter.com/rasmus_kleis/status/1014071175415246848&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905891000">experts disagree</a>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>One theory on addressing this is to make clear to users when they are inside their bubble (their personal walled garden<sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup>) and to allow them to easily step outside of it, whenever they want. The theory is that people won&#x2019;t always choose to be sheltered, but will instead sometimes look for adventure, or something, &#x201C;outside the wall.&#x201D; &#xA0; One early tool for &#x201C;stepping outside&#x201D; is &#xA0;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905892000">Blue Feed, Red Feed</a>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It has also been suggested that prediction markets incentivize accurate broad knowledge, leading people outside their bubbles, and that commerce/trade in general motivates people to connect across different &#x201C;tribes&#x201D; and help people get along regardless of &#x201C;tribal affiliation&#x201D;</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.ygjgm6xcaohr">Privacy</h2>
        <p>Some credibility solutions may impact privacy. For example, a browser plug-in which checks every page the user visits using its proprietary cloud-based service could potentially misuse or leak information. If designed without due safety measures, it could easily leak private URLs the user visits, and in some cases could even leak secret page contents, such as the user&#x2019;s medical communications&#xA0;or their employer&#x2019;s proprietary data, when accessed via the browser.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.erwe81uzigvy">Other Unintended consequences</h2>
        <p>It can be hard to predict all the ways a technological intervention can go wrong. For example, Facebook reported that adding warnings to newsfeed items indicating when an item had been debunked by fact-checkers resulted in more people reading and spreading false news. Predicting, detecting, and if necessary changing course away from such effects can be even harder in standardized, multi-vendor, decentralized systems.</p>
        <p></p>

    <h1 id="h.v8boqqhafijm">Terminology</h1>
    <p>In this document we have attempted to use terms consistently and precisely, hoping to help promote wider consensus on terminology for the field. We are being both descriptive and a bit prescriptive here, although we recognize that better terms may emerge and supplant these.</p>

        <h2 id="h.43d5m1wbjs7u">Roles in a Credibility Ecosystem</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>&#xA0;A single party may play multiple roles in the flow of a single news item.</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul><li>(Content) <b>Consumer</b>: person who is receiving and experiencing some content. &#xA0;Similar to: Audience Member, Reader, Viewer, Listener, Receiver, User</li><li>(Content) <b>Provider</b>&#xA0;or <b>Source</b>: person or organization who provided the consumer with some content. There may be a supply chain of providers, creating and assembling content before it reaches the consumer, and then sometimes a chain of friends who act as provider, passing the content on to each other. Often this is invisible to the consumer, who perceives (and makes credibility assessments about) a single apparent provider. &#xA0;<sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup>Similar to: Producer, Creator, Author, Publisher. &#xA0;&#x201C;Source&#x201D; is often more ambiguous, but is used as an alternative with &#x201C;provider&#x201D; is awkward.</li><li>(Content) <b>Promoter</b>: person or organization who intentionally or unintentionally increases the spread of content. In social media platforms, this can be as simple as &#x201C;liking&#x201D;. Commenting on content or linking to it, even to refute it, can increase its spread and visibility due to various algorithms. </li><li>(Credibility) <b>Facilitator</b>: &#xA0;person or organization who is helping the consumer decide what to trust. &#xA0;Similar to:&#xA0;Moderator, Fact-Checker, Forum or Comments Editor.<sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup></li><li>(Web-Based Communication) <b>Platform</b>: technological system, and by extension the person or organization who maintains and controls it, which is providing the above parties with the infrastructure which enables the content to pass among them. Often controls which items are allowed and ranks items to influence which are seen. Includes content management systems (CMSs), web browsers, search engines, news feeds&#xA0;(as in social networks and microblogging services), and media sharing platforms.</li></ul>

        <h2 id="h.k3a5bxg8k9ru">Credibility</h2>
        <p>[ disclaimer disclaimer&#x2026; &#xA0; are these any good? &#xA0;Is this helpful? &#xA0;Or are we just wandering into philosophy unnecessarily? ]</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Claim. </b>&#xA0;An assertion that is open to disagreement; a meaningful declarative sentence which is logically either true or false&#xA0;(to some degree); &#xA0;a proposition in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905896000">propositional logic</a>. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Fact.</b>&#xA0;A claim that is true; a claim that accurately describes the actual state of the world.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Accuracy. </b>Degree of truth, especially for claims involving measurements. Can be a useful concept to avoid pedantic distinctions around truth. The claim, &#x201C;The radius of the earth is 6400 km&#x201D;, is only somewhat true, as 6371 km is a more accurate figure. Of course, it is not <i>exactly</i>&#xA0;6371 km, either. Similarly, most &#x201C;true&#x201D; statements are not perfectly and completely true, so considering their accuracy may be more helpful.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Believe</b>&#xA0;(of a claim, as in: &#x201C;Alice believes the world is round&#x201D;). To be in the mental state of accepting (and consequently behaving as if) the claim is true, at least within some limited context. &#xA0;Evidence suggests people can sometimes believe contradictory claims and switch among them depending on the context. <b>Trusting </b>a claim is essentially synonymous, although perhaps a bit stronger, like &#x201C;firmly believing&#x201D;. One approach to measuring strength of belief is asking how much someone would bet on the claim being true. People routinely bet their lives for minor gain on their trust in the safety of products like cars and medicines.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Misled</b>&#xA0;(by some information)<b>.</b>&#xA0;The mental state of having been reasonably led by some information to believe one or more false claims. Becoming convinced of unproven claims is not sufficient to qualify as being misled. &#xA0;The mental process connecting the information to the false belief must be &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D; (in the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905897000">legal sense</a>), otherwise one could conclude one was &#x201C;misled&#x201D; when one is simply mistaken. In contrast to being mistaken, if one is &#x201C;misled&#x201D;, at least some fault lies with the information, which we then call &#x201C;<b>misinformation&#x201D;.</b></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Deceived</b>. Misled on purpose (much liked <b>disinformation</b>&#xA0;is intentional misinformation).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Trustworthy</b>&#xA0;(of information). Extremely unlikely to mislead. By labeling information &#x201C;trustworthy&#x201D;, one is saying the risk of any one consumer being misled is small enough that it should be ignored. <b>Trustworthiness </b>is the degree to which something is trustworthy. &#x201C;Trustworthy&#x201D; differs from &#x201C;true&#x201D; in that poorly-expressed true information can still mislead, and things that are not true, like jokes, can still be trustworthy, if they won&apos;t actually mislead anyone.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Credibility </b>(of information)<sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup>. The degree to which information <i>appears</i>&#xA0;trustworthy. Credibility differs from trustworthiness when appearances are misleading. People are tricked into false beliefs when false information has high credibility (it appears trustworthy to them), and they resist believing true claims (actual facts) when they consider the information containing those claims to have low credibility. Reasonable people can disagree about the credibility of some information, but because credibility is based on <i>appearances</i>&#xA0;&#x2014; objectively observable features &#x2014; it may be easier to collaborate and come to agreement than on more hidden features like trustworthiness. The term <b>credibility</b>&#xA0;can also be used broadly to refer to the problem space around trust, as in &#x201C;credibility researchers&#x201D; or &#x201C;credibility software&#x201D;. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Credibility Score </b>(of some information, in some information distribution environment)<b>.</b>&#xA0;A formalization of credibility as the statistical probability that the given information will not mislead members of the population who consume it in the given environment. (This is a straw proposal for a definition, aiming to allow interoperability of credibility information. Research is required to refine and validate this definition. Consider citing a specific version of this report when using this term, if you mean it in this precise way.) </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Someone claiming that information is <b>credible</b>&#xA0;or <b>has high credibility</b>&#xA0;is asserting that the information appears sufficiently unlikely to mislead that they think it should be believed. &#xA0;Similarly, saying information is <b>not credible</b>&#xA0;or that it <b>has low credibility</b>&#xA0;is saying that it should not be believed because it appears too likely to mislead, in the speaker&#x2019;s estimation.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The process of <b>credibility assessment</b>&#xA0;can be done for oneself or for others. &#xA0;For oneself, it is the act of deciding what to believe, which is often informal, immediate, and unconscious. Doing credibility assessment for others requires analysis of available evidence bearing on the probability the information will be misleading. &#xA0;This may result in a report (which might itself be called a &#x201C;credibility assessment&#x201D;) and/or a credibility score. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Credibility assessment tools</b>&#xA0;are software features or applications which perform credibility assessment or help people do so.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The definitions above framed in terms of information&#xA0;and content can be extended to apply to <b>content providers</b>, understanding that they apply to all the information provided, or all the information provided in some context. &#xA0;For example, a provider might have a different credibility score for each day, based on all the information they provide that day.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.c47mvejndkvt">Inputs to Credibility Assessment</h2>
        <p>Credibility assessment can be done using a variety of strategies (discussed throughout much of this document), based on observable features of the content item being assessed, as well is information around it (metadata), and information about entities which relate to it in various ways, such as the entity who provided it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>All of this information feeding into a credibility assessment process can be broken into individual features, which are commonly called <b>credibility signals</b>&#xA0;when being used by automated systems. In contrast, <b>credibility indicators</b>&#xA0;are more commonly understood as features which humans use in assessing credibility. &#xA0;In particular, machines may process the <b>signals</b>&#xA0;to produce additional <b>indicators</b>&#xA0;(such as icons or color coding) to help users rapidly decide what to trust.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This signal-vs-indicator distinction is currently followed in some communities but not others. &#xA0;To be clear, consider using phrases like <b>machine signals</b>&#xA0;and <b>visual indicators</b>, depending on your context. (We note that this distinction has been emerging in the greater community, but does not appear naturally in English, as the automotive terms &#x201C;turn signal&#x201D; and &#x201C;turn indicator&#x201D; are each in widespread use in different regions.)&#xA0;</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.4nvodw32hqjj">Assessment Strategies: How Can People Tell What To Believe?</h2>
        <p>Techniques for assessing credibility can be grouped roughly into the following four types of strategies. Each of these strategies could be applied with a wide range of computer assistance, and some technologies will likely combine elements of several strategies.</p>
        <p></p>

    <h1 id="h.ij0k32jlsndm">Granularity: Which Entities Are You Assessing for Credibility?</h1>
    <p>People necessarily make credibility assessments about content items and about the people who provided the content. It seems likely they make these assessments across a wide range of granularities, all of which need to be taken into account in understanding and assisting with credibility.</p>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.5uftu3raaxuh">People and Organizations (Content Providers)</h2>
        <p>Content providers can each be assessed for credibility; that is, one can attempt to determine the probability the information they provide is trustworthy. &#xA0;This assessment might be done across a wide range of granularities, from the very large and general, to the very small and specific:</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul><li>For example, Harvard University is a large-granularity source, comprising many people over several centuries. It can be (and often is) considered to have a degree of aggregate credibility. Information seen as coming from Harvard is, in most circles, seen as relatively credible, no matter the topic or when it was published.</li><li>Getting smaller in granularity, a particular Harvard professor might be seen to have their own credibility.</li><li>Smaller still, that professor might have high credibility in one topic, where they are a widely published expert, and low credibility in another another, where they are outside their field of expertise.</li><li>Finally, we could zoom in to very small granularity, picking a particular time. &#xA0;A witness might have generally high credibility, but during one particular evening they might be known to be mentally impaired and so have low credibility.</li></ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.st1avm3jie2h">Content and Claims</h2>
        <p>Reasoning about the&#xA0;credibility of content&#xA0;similarly requires working with a range of granularities.&#xA0;For example, we might consider the credibility of a complete snapshot of Wikipedia, or of a particular Wikipedia page, or the text of a paragraph, or a specific claim.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Content which does not make explicit assertions, including jokes and photographs, can also be seen as implying a variety of claims, although that implication relationship may itself be subject to uncertainty. &#xA0; </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="h.anvuxde13i6n">Complications due to the Web</h2>
        <p>In general, working with metadata about web content, it often works to design for web pages, then extend the granularity up to origins (loosely, domain names) and down to fragments (loosely, portions of a page or portions of media shown on the page). &#xA0;Note that the Web Annotation framework <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-states/%23json-examples-converted-to-fragment-identifiers&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905906000">specifies a way</a>&#xA0;to make essentially any portion of any version of a page be its own addressable fragment, although that is&#xA0;not yet widely implemented.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Sites which aggregate content from other providers, including social media sites, will need special consideration, as will sites which analyze or review other content, sometimes including false content as an example or evidence.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Credibility ratings for a web page may at first seem to be just about whether the <i>content</i>&#xA0;is trustworthy, but in practice websites can change their content or even secretly show different content to different observers, so the trustworthiness<sup><a href="#cmnt8" id="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup>&#xA0;of the site maintainer is a factor as well. For assessments to securely apply to just the intended content of a page and not also include its provider, some mechanism is needed to securely indicate the exact content being considered<sup><a href="#cmnt9" id="cmnt_ref9">[i]</a></sup>. &#xA0;</p>

        <p>Providers of untrustworthy information have many motivations, and often their motivations will never be known. Still, it can help to consider some of these types of attackers and their motives:&#xA0;<br></p>
        <ol start="1"><li>Ethical business, wants long term business relationship. &#xA0;This is legitimate advertising&#xA0;which turns into an attack when it goes too far, perhaps accidentally misjudging the consumer&#x2019;s knowledge, reasoning ability, or resources</li><li>Unethical or illegal business, wants money with little regard for consequences. Can range from selling useless or dangerous products to starting rumours which impact stock prices</li><li>Non-ideological political operative, wants legitimately-obtained authority (&#x201C;tribal&#x201D; power) </li><li>Ideological political operative (activist), wants to change society in a specific way</li><li>Prankster, wants amusement or personal attention</li><li>Person seeking entertainment or satisfaction at the expense of others, eg by provoking an argument</li><li>Mentally unstable person, displaying erratic, irrational behavior</li></ol>

    <h1 id="h.rmx3ty7g6ge9">Getting Adoption</h1>
    <p>Many of the proposed solutions have strong network effects. They offer users minimal value until they have a critical mass of users. This makes it quite challenging to achieve adoption.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This kind of challenge is usually addressed by achieving critical mass in a small community and then expanding outward. (Facebook famously started just at Harvard then gradually expanded to other universities before eventually opening to the public.) Within that smaller community, adoption can be promoted or even required by the people managing the community.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Some specific approaches:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul><li>Via content providers to their community; eg news site embeds credibility assessment tool in their web pages</li><li>Via cms plugin providers</li><li>Via enterprise, to their employees, including via standard machine configs</li><li>Via schools, on school-managed platforms and by getting students to install on their own systems</li><li>Via membership organization which can convince its members to install app/plugin</li><li>Via social graph, using &#x201C;help protect your community/friends&#x201D; pitch</li><li>Implement in browser</li><li>Implement in platform</li><li>Via ecosystem of credibility products</li></ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>In general, funding is an issue. There is are not yet any clear business models for credibility systems. Philanthropic funding may be necessary, at least for now. &#xA0;</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h1 id="h.7vnom1uxezjj">User Experience (UX)</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>The user experience (UX) of credibility assessment tools is likely to vary widely, given the range in granularity, subject matter, and computing environments where credibility matters and software can help. Some of the ways users might experience credibility assessment tools:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul><li>as a feature built into a browser</li><li>as a browser extension</li><li>as a web app</li><li>as a native app</li><li>as part of a newsfeed</li><li>as part of a web search engine</li><li>as part of a website&apos;s search function</li></ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>We can organize the discussion of possible tool designs using a spectrum of user effort, from no effort at all, where the user benefits without doing anything, up to major effort, where a user might be spending hours or even days trying to determine whether to trust a single claim. The appropriate tools are quite different at different points along this spectrum. We will use this concept for organize tool discussions below, but here we consider it in three ranges. &#xA0;</p>

        <h2 id="h.vcnrv18hbkbk">Review Board Process</h2>
        <p>As detailed above, in <a href="#h.bjkr6l1byyj4">First, Do No Harm</a>, it is quite possible for credibility standards work to do significant unintended damage. One technique which might help mitigate this risk would be to adhere to an independent (or adversarial) review process. &#xA0;These review processes are often seen:</p>
        <ul><li>W3C has a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html%23horizontal-review&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905960000">Horizontal Review process</a>, where developing standards must be reviewed for considerations such as accessibility, internationalization, and privacy. In some cases, such as privacy, which have low staffing levels, this is a self-review process.</li><li>In the US and many other countries, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905961000">Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)</a>, must review and approve plans for any scientific research using human subjects</li><li>In some parts of the world, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.aipce.net/whatIsAPressCouncil.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905961000">Press Councils</a>&#xA0;enforce the Code of Practice of journalistic organizations. </li></ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>These boards can be expensive to operate and their process can be slow and unpleasant. They can, however, provide an antidote to the tendency of people to be blind to flaws in proposals they support. &#xA0;This is possible as long as one or more members of the board is careful to remain disinterested. Alternative, an adversarial process (as seen in courts) could be set up where some people are tasked with finding flaws and arguing against a proposal. A third option is to simply rely on wide public review (as per normal W3C process) and hope someone will comment strongly on any major issues.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>A review board like this, capable of overseeing potential interventions around credibility, might be useful beyond W3C. &#xA0;It could also be useful for vendor-specific interventions, where a vendor seeks advice about possible impact of a proposed change. &#xA0;In any case, a board like this could bring considerable credibility to the process if staffed with people respected by diverse stakeholders.<br></p>
        <p>Possible organizations to cooperate with in setting up a board like this include <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905962000">the Internet Governance Forum</a>&#xA0;and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905962000">the Global Network Initiative,</a>&#xA0;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It may also be possible to set up experimental situations, to validate proposals with limited impact. &#xA0;Of course, A/B testing is this on a small scale. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://civilservant.io/about_us.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905963000">Civil Servant</a>&#xA0;has developed some methodologies which may be helpful.</p>

        <p>Each of the below potential standards is intended to allow systems to interoperate by sharing data with common syntax and semantics. &#xA0;The expectation is that data sharing will be done in a manner compatible with of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://schema.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905963000">schema.org</a>&#xA0;using W3C standard data technologies like <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905963000">JSON-LD</a>. These build on the underlying general graph model of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905963000">RDF</a>&#xA0;and support related technologies like the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537977905964000">SPARQL</a>&#xA0;query language, but can usually be used as ordinary JSON embedded in web pages. In each case, the purpose is to allow various independent systems to provide data feeds which can be easily and unambiguously understood by other systems across the Web.</p>

        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1">[a]</a>If you were going to add a parenthetical comment here, I&apos;d suggest something more specific rather than another metaphor. I.e., both &quot;bubble&quot; and &quot;personal walled garden&quot; are metaphors. If you want to clarify the tern &quot;bubble,&quot; add an actual definition. Something like &quot;A filter bubble is a state of intellectual isolation that can result from personalized filters that allow a person to only see what they wish to see&quot; (which I just wrote, adapted from Wikipedia).</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref2" id="cmnt2">[b]</a>Making that chain of provenance explicit and visible would be one important kind of credibility indicator.</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref3" id="cmnt3">[c]</a>Good point. &#xA0;Leaving this note here until I&apos;m sure it&apos;s recorded down below.</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref4" id="cmnt4">[d]</a>According to this, it seems that Facilitator is mostly an &quot;assigned&quot; role. In some settings, &quot;regular&quot; users may act as credibility facilitators, e.g. in an online discussion, commenters may leave clues or present analysis/evidence that could help with such assessments. Wouldn&apos;t they be considered Facilitators in such contexts?</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref5" id="cmnt5">[e]</a>first pass: i like this and think it works. &#xA0;going to continue to think about it, because i wonder if this is worth a literature review for definitions from different disciplines (something we could ask an intern to help with, perhaps +an@meedan.com ?) &#xA0;consider this definition, sociologically based: &quot;Credibility can be understood as the ability to be believed&#x2014;in other words, the ability to create perceptions that one is telling the truth. Credibility is closely related to trustworthiness, and they overlap when the person or institution in question has a reputation both for being truthful (credible), and for having good intentions toward others (trustworthy).&quot; -- McPherson, E., 2012. Spot News Versus Reportage: Newspaper Models, the Distribution of Newsroom Credibility, and Implications for Democratic Journalism in Mexico. International Journal of Communication, 6, pp.2301&#x2013;2317. &#xA0; a slightly different emphasis on the relationship between the producer&apos;s ability and the audience&apos;s range of belief.</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref6" id="cmnt6">[f]</a>so maybe it&apos;s good to see at least what working definitions are out there for awareness, so it can feed back into thinking...</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref7" id="cmnt7">[g]</a>I agree. Transparency also places the onus on the creator/publisher to establish parameters for evaluating the work and where the work resides according to some hopefully standard definitions.. If corroboration fails at points along the way, then it is the responsibility solely of the creator/publisher - no evaluator bias involved.</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref8" id="cmnt8">[h]</a>trustworthiness or clear practice of publication protocol? &#xA0;also thinking that probably some bloggers and small outfits are trustworthy, but they take advantage of the editorial freedom that online publishing gives them, and dink with texts now and then. &#xA0;(which is why access timedate stamp is part of some citation processes)</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref9" id="cmnt9">[i]</a>And its change history! The Wayback helps in a coarsely granular way. https://twitter.com/nyt_diff does a much more focused thing. But there&apos;s lots of space along the continuum between those extremes.</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref10" id="cmnt10">[j]</a>Mental stability is not a binary proposition. &#xA0;In the preface to his book entitled Everyday Irrationality: How Pseudo-Scientists, Lunatics, and the Rest of Us Systematically Fail to Think Rationally, Robyn Dawes suggests that it is not just</p><p>schizophrenics who reason according to the &#x201C;Von Domarus principle.&#x201D; Indeed, he demonstrated</p><p>in his doctoral dissertation that normal people &#x201C;distort newspaper-like stories in ways consistent</p><p>with the principles of psychotic reasoning.&#x201D; http://ambur.net/irrationality.pdf</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref11" id="cmnt11">[k]</a>It would be good if the agendas for significant gatherings were published as performance plans in an open, standard, machine-readable format like StratML Part 2, Performance Plans &amp; Reports.</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref12" id="cmnt12">[l]</a>the three modes have overlap. for instance, users could choose to turn on filtering/blocking or tweak their personal algorithm to demote certain content. I think there is an assumption that all of these are platform operated but they need not be.</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref13" id="cmnt13">[m]</a>It may be possible to &quot;nudge&quot; folks without unduly impinging upon their autonomy. &#xA0;As Thaler &amp; Sunstein have suggested, the key is to ensure that it is easy for them to make another choice if they wish.</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref14" id="cmnt14">[n]</a>This shifts the trust target from the document to the tool, the signals it extracts, and the user ability to interpret them. We might want to clarify these aspects as well.</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref15" id="cmnt15">[o]</a>Do we want to discuss, here, the platform vs browser dynamic w/respect to how fact-checks are (or can be) found and displayed relative to content?</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref16" id="cmnt16">[p]</a>linked citations</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref17" id="cmnt17">[q]</a>Lots of issues with this though in current form.</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref18" id="cmnt18">[r]</a>Should we perhaps link to https://github.com/w3c/cred-claims and https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1969 to make the point there is more to do?</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref19" id="cmnt19">[s]</a>What about Expressing the &quot;credibility history&quot; of a provider (e.g. past verified or debunked posts)? It is somewhat related to bias, but more explicitly linked with a credibility prior.</p></div>
        <div><p><a href="#cmnt_ref20" id="cmnt20">[t]</a>That strikes me as more Corroboration -- claims which are verified or debunked -- just with a broader time horizon. &#xA0; That should definitely be added here somewhere. &#xA0;And yeah, as a user, I might expect that to be more about reputation than corroboration. &#xA0;Hrrrrrrrm.</p></div>
