    Introduction</span></h1>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Can you tell, when you're
    looking at a random web page, whether you should trust it? When
    scanning a page of search results, do you know which matches
    come from legitimate sources and which are scams? When reading
    a news feed, can you tell which items ought to be believed and
    which are slanted, manipulative, or outright lies? Perhaps most
    importantly, what happens when you inevitably guess wrong while
    making some of these credibility assessments, and you
    unknowingly share falsehoods to your community? &nbsp;What if
    you are misled into making bad decisions for yourself and the
    people you care about?</span></p>

    Credible Web Community Group</a></span><span>&nbsp;formed at
    W3C</span><span class="c1">, the organization which develops
    technical standards for the web, to look for technological
    solutions for this “credibility assessment” problem. It's not
    that we think tech can solve every problem, especially ones as
    deeply human and complex as this one, but it seems likely that
    some tech is making matters worse and that other designs could
    probably serve people better. For some of us, creating better
    approaches to credibility assessment seems like a good way to
    help.</span></p>

        There may be a supply chain of providers, creating and

    Scope</span></h1>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Web-centric technical solutions
    which requires standardization</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The web isn't everything but
    it's arguably the knowledge backbone of the world today.
    &nbsp;Everything can and usually does tie back to the web to
    some degree, so if the web is a reliable source of accuracy,
    that should help quite a bit.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Data interchange vocabularies are the
    likely main area to standardize. See below,</span> <span class=
    "c4"><a class="c8" href="#h.wpcxeg3cugmx">Potential New Web
    Standards</a></span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Browser functionality is another
    possibility, but the bar is much higher, and none of the
    current proposals require that to function, although it would
    certainly help with deployment.</span></p>

      <h2 class="c5" id="h.2cd6cv1rre9i"><span class="c7">
      Censorship</span></h2>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The regulation of content
      (called "censorship" in some contexts) is controversial.
      Nearly every country in the world considers publication of
      certain kinds of material immoral and illegal (such as child
      pornography). &nbsp;At the same time, many of the same
      countries express the value of free speech and a free press,
      sometimes in very broad language. To humans, the difference
      may be laughably clear, but in general a computer system
      designed to allow one kind of content to be blocked can also
      be used to block all the other kinds.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c3"></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Additionally, the people and
      computing systems involved in a potentially-problematic
      communication may be spread out over time and place, each
      subject to different cultural views and applicable legal
      authorities.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c3"></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps the best path forward
      is to aim for systems which allow users to publish and view
      any available content they chose, but also to enable those
      individuals to be held accountable if they break the laws
      which apply to them. Legitimate needs for anonymity could be
      handled within such a scheme by using trusted proxies, such
      as journalists.</span></p>

      Centralization</span></h2>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some proposals require or
      facilitate centralization, such as the idea of establishing
      and enforcing uniform standards for journalism. &nbsp;These
      approaches have some appeal and might be effective, but
      centralization is antithetical to Web Architecture and would
      likely introduce problems with scaling, censorship, and
      political bias. We have been considering centralized
      approaches out-of-scope, and aim for designs which give the
      end-user final control over their computing
      platform.</span></p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="c5" id="h.1g77pcw323di"><span class="c7">
      Tribalism, Echo Chambers, Filter Bubbles</span></h2>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some proposals are likely to
      increase the degree to which consumers see only the content
      they want to see or their community wants them to see,
      regardless of its accuracy.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c3"></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">One theory on addressing this
      is to make clear to users when they are inside their bubble
      (their personal walled garden) and to allow them to easily
      step outside of it, whenever they want. The theory is that
      people won’t always choose to be sheltered, but will instead
      sometimes be looking for adventure, or something, “outside
      the wall”. &nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c3"></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>It has also been suggested that
      prediction markets incentivize accurate broad knowledge,
      leading people outside their bubbles, and that commerce/trade
      in general motivates people to connect between “tribes” and
      help people get along regardless of “tribe”.</span></p>

      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">eg Facebook result that
      warning labels on false news increased increased engagement,
      so test thoroughly before deploying at scale. &nbsp;That’s
      very hard to do in decentralized/open systems.</span></p>

      Review Board</span></h2>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">People are notoriously bad at
      seeing the downsides of work they support. As such, an
      adversarial approval process -- where work must be reviewed
      by disinterested and potentially hostile parties before it
      can proceed -- is often useful to vet work that needs to be
      of high quality.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c3"></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>It may be wise to set up a Review Board
      to oversee potential interventions around credibility. Models
      for this include</span> <span class="c4"><a class="c8" href=
      "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1535240195132000">
      IRBs</a></span><span>, approval processes for medical

      W3C's Horizontal Review process</a></span><span class=
      "c1">.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c3"></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>Such a review board might be useful for
      vendor-specific interventions as well as standards-based
      ones, and could bring considerable credibility to the process
      if staffed with people respected by diverse
      stakeholders.</span></p>

    Granularity: Which Entities Are You Assessing for
    Credibility?</span></h1>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">People necessarily make
    credibility assessments about content items and about the
    people who provided the content. It seems likely they make
    these assessments across a wide range of
    granularities.</span></p>
    <section>
      <h2 class="c5" id="h.5uftu3raaxuh"><span> People and
      Organizations (Content Providers)</span></h2>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, Harvard
      University would be large-granularity source, comprising many
      people over several centuries, but still having some degree
      of aggregate credibility. &nbsp;In contrast, in considering
      the credibility of Harvard Professor Jonathan Zittrain, one
      would be working at a smaller granularity. &nbsp;An even
      smaller granularity might be Professor Zittrain during a
      given conversation or on a given topic. &nbsp;For example, he
      might be much more credible when speaking about issues
      concerning the Internet and Society than about 12th century
      French poetry.</span></p>

      Claims</span></h2>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reasoning about the
      credibility of content similarly requires working with a
      range of granularities. For example, we might consider the
      credibility of a snapshot of Wikipedia, or of a particular
      Wikipedia page, or the text of a paragraph, or a specific
      claim.</span></p>

      <h2 class="c5" id="h.anvuxde13i6n"><span> Complications
      due to the Web</span></h2>
      <p class="c0"><span>In general, working with metadata about
      web content, it often works to design for web pages, then
      extend the granularity up to origins (loosely, domain names)
      and down to fragments (loosely, portions of a page or
      portions of media shown on the page). &nbsp;Note that the Web
      Annotation framework</span> <span class="c4"><a class="c8"
      href=
      "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-states/%23json-examples-converted-to-fragment-identifiers&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1535240195135000">
      specifies a way</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class=
      "c1">to make essentially any portion of any version of a page
      be its own addressable fragment, although that it not yet
      widely implemented.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c3"></p>
      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sites which aggregate content
      from other providers, including social media sites, will need
      special consideration, as will sites which analyze or review
      other content, sometimes including false content as an
      example or evidence.</span></p>
      <p class="c0 c3"></p>
      <p class="c0"><span>Credibility ratings for a web page may at
      first seem to be just about whether the</span> <span class=
      "c14">content</span><span>&nbsp;is trustworthy, but in
      practice websites can change their content or even secretly
      show different content to different observers, so the
      trustworthiness of the site maintainer is a factor as well.
      For assessments to securely apply to just the intended
      content of a page and not also include its provider, some
      mechanism is needed to securely indicate the exact content
      being considered. &nbsp;</span></p>

    Assessment Strategies: How Can You Tell What To
    Believe?</span></h1>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Techniques for assessing
    credibility can be grouped roughly into the following four
    types of strategies. &nbsp;These grouping were originally based
    on particular projects which focused on only one of the areas.
    &nbsp;Each of these strategies could be applied with a wide
    range of computer assistance, and some technologies will likely
    combine elements of several strategies.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c3"></p>
    <ol class="c9 lst-kix_p7q2rab08g0j-0 start" start="1">
      <li class="c0 c2"><span class=
      "c10">Inspection.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Look closely
      at the content (and the page where it appears) for the
      presence of features which are statistically associated with
      low or high credibility. This may be the primary strategy
      consumers use unconsciously while reading. The hope is that
      assessment accuracy can be significantly improved with
      computer assistance and suitable grounding
      research.</span></li>
      <li class="c0 c2"><span class=
      "c10">Corroboration.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Identify
      salient claims made (or implied, or relied upon) in the
      content and check other sources which offer an assessment of
      the claim (eg fact-checks), or related claims, or evidence
      helping the consumer accurately assess the claim.
      &nbsp;</span></li>
      <li class="c0 c2"><span class=
      "c10">Reputation.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Assess the
      credibility of a content provider by gathering statements
      about them from other high-credibility providers. &nbsp;This
      can be done recursively, forming a reputation network from a
      few known and trusted “root” providers to help assess many
      unknown and suspect ones. &nbsp;</span></li>
      <li class="c0 c2"><span class=
      "c10">Transparency.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Consider
      what the provider says about themselves and their content.
      &nbsp;For instance, content may be labeled as opinion or even
      satire, and providers may label themselves as partisan or
      having processes and controls the consumer views as
      untrustworthy. &nbsp;By itself, this data is easy to fake,
      but coupled with corroboration, reputation, and off-line
      social and legal incentives, it may be quite
      effective.</span></li>
